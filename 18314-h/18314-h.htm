<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Although the distinguished seamen, whose lives
and professional characteristics it is the object
of this work to present in brief summary, belonged
to a service now foreign to that of the United States,
they have numerous and varied points of contact with
America; most of them very close, and in some instances
of marked historical interest. The older men,
indeed, were during much of their careers our fellow
countrymen in the colonial period, and fought, some
side by side with our own people in this new world,
others in distant scenes of the widespread strife that
characterized the middle of the eighteenth century, the
beginnings of "world politics;" when, in a quarrel
purely European in its origin, "black men," to use
Macaulay's words, "fought on the coast of Coromandel,
and red men scalped each other by the great lakes of
North America." All, without exception, were actors
in the prolonged conflict that began in 1739 concerning
the right of the ships of Great Britain and her colonies
to frequent the seas bordering the American dominions
of Spain; a conflict which, by gradual expansion, drew
in the continent of Europe, from Russia to France,
spread thence to the French possessions in India and
North America, involved Spanish Havana in the western
hemisphere and Manila in the eastern, and finally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
entailed the expulsion of France from our continent.
Thence, by inevitable sequence, issued the independence
of the United States. The contest, thus completed,
covered forty-three years.</p>

<p>The four seniors of our series, Hawke, Rodney, Howe,
and Jervis, witnessed the whole of this momentous
period, and served conspicuously, some more, some less,
according to their age and rank, during its various
stages. Hawke, indeed, was at the time of the American
Revolution too old to go to sea, but he did not die
until October 16, 1781, three days before the surrender
of Cornwallis at Yorktown, which is commonly accepted
as the closing incident of our struggle for independence.
On the other hand, the two younger men, Saumarez and
Pellew, though they had entered the navy before the
American Revolution, saw in it the beginnings of an
active service which lasted to the end of the Napoleonic
wars, the most continuous and gigantic strife of modern
times. It was as the enemies of our cause that they
first saw gunpowder burned in anger.</p>

<p>Nor was it only amid the commonplaces of naval
warfare that they then gained their early experiences in
America. Pellew in 1776, on Lake Champlain, bore a
brilliant part in one of the most decisive&mdash;though
among the least noted&mdash;campaigns of the Revolutionary
contest; and a year later, as leader of a small contingent
of seamen, he shared the fate of Burgoyne's army at
Saratoga. In 1776 also, Saumarez had his part in an
engagement which ranks among the bloodiest recorded
between ships and forts, being on board the British
flag-ship Bristol at the attack upon Fort Moultrie, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
naval analogue of Bunker Hill; for, in the one of these
actions as in the other, the great military lesson was the
resistant power against frontal attack of resolute marksmen,
though untrained to war, when fighting behind
entrenchments,&mdash;a teaching renewed at New Orleans,
and emphasized in the recent South African War. The
well-earned honors of the comparatively raw colonials
received generous recognition at the time from their opponents,
even in the midst of the bitterness proverbially
attendant upon family quarrels; but it is only just to
allow that their endurance found its counterpart in the
resolute and persistent valor of the assailants. In these
two battles, with which the War of Independence may
be said fairly to have begun, by land and by water, in
the far North and in the far South, the men of the same
stock, whose ancestors there met face to face as foes,
have now in peace a common heritage of glory. If
little of bitterness remains in the recollections which
those who are now fellow-citizens retain of the struggle
between the North and the South, within the American
Republic, we of two different nations, who yet share a
common tongue and a common tradition of liberty and
law, may well forget the wrongs of the earlier strife, and
look only to the common steadfast courage with which
each side then bore its share in a civil conflict.</p>

<p>The professional lives of these men, therefore, touch
history in many points; not merely history generally,
but American history specifically. Nor is this contact
professional only, devoid of personal tinge. Hawke was
closely connected by blood with the Maryland family
of Bladen; that having been his mother's maiden name,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
and Governor Bladen of the then colony being his first
cousin. Very much of his early life was spent upon the
American Station, largely in Boston. But those were
the days of Walpole's peace policy; and when the maritime
war, which the national outcry at last compelled,
attained large dimensions, Hawke's already demonstrated
eminence as a naval leader naturally led to his employment
in European waters, where the more immediate
dangers, if not the greatest interests, of Great Britain
were then felt to be. The universal character, as well as
the decisive issues of the opening struggle were as yet
but dimly foreseen. Rodney also had family ties with
America, though somewhat more remote. C&aelig;sar Rodney,
a signer of the Declaration of Independence from
Delaware, was of the same stock; their great-grandfathers
were brothers. It was from the marriage of his
ancestor with the daughter of a Sir Thomas C&aelig;sar that
the American Rodney derived his otherwise singular
name.</p>

<p>Howe, as far as known, had no relations on this side
of the water; but his elder brother, whom he succeeded
in the title, was of all British officers the one who most
won from the colonial troops with whom he was associated
a personal affection, the memory of which has
been transmitted to us; while the admiral's own kindly
attitude towards the colonists, and his intimacy with
Franklin, no less than his professional ability, led to his
being selected for the North American command at the
time when the home country had not yet lost all hope
of a peaceable solution of difficulties. To this the Howe
tradition was doubtless expected to contribute. Jervis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
a man considerably younger than the other three, by the
accidents of his career came little into touch with either
the colonies or the colonists, whether before or during
the Revolutionary epoch; yet even he, by his intimate
friendship with Wolfe, and intercourse with his last days,
is brought into close relation with an event and a name
indelibly associated with one of the great landmarks&mdash;crises&mdash;in
the history of the American Continent. Although
the issue of the strife depended, doubtless, upon
deeper and more far-reaching considerations, it is not
too much to say that in the heights of Quebec, and in
the name of Wolfe, is signalized the downfall of the
French power in America. There was prefigured the
ultimate predominance of the traditions of the English-speaking
races throughout this continent, which in our
own momentous period stands mediator between the
two ancient and contrasted civilizations of Europe and
Asia, that so long moved apart, but are now brought
into close, if not threatening, contact.</p>

<p>Interesting, however, as are the historical and social
environments in which their personalities played their
part, it is as individual men, and as conspicuous exemplars&mdash;types&mdash;of
the varied characteristics which go
to the completeness of an adequate naval organization,
that they are here brought forward. Like other professions,&mdash;and
especially like its sister service, the Army,&mdash;the
Navy tends to, and for efficiency requires, specialization.
Specialization, in turn, results most satisfactorily
from the free play of natural aptitudes; for aptitudes,
when strongly developed, find expression in inclination,
and readily seek their proper function in the body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
organic to which they belong. Each of these distinguished
officers, from this point of view, does not stand
for himself alone, but is an eminent exponent of a class;
while the class itself forms a member of a body which
has many organs, no one of which is independent of the
other, but all contributive to the body's welfare. Hence,
while the effort has been made to present each in his
full individuality, with copious recourse to anecdote and
illustrative incident as far as available, both as a matter
of general interest and for accurate portrayal, special
care has been added to bring out occurrences and actions
which convey the impression of that natural character
which led the man to take the place he did in the naval
body, to develop the professional function with which
he is more particularly identified; for personality underlies
official character.</p>

<p>In this sense of the word, types are permanent; for
such are not the exclusive possession of any age or of
any service, but are found and are essential in every
period and to every nation. Their functions are part of
the bed-rock of naval organization and of naval strategy,
throughout all time; and the particular instances here
selected owe their special cogency mainly to the fact
that they are drawn from a naval era, 1739-1815, of
exceptional activity and brilliancy.</p>

<p>There is, however, another sense in which an officer,
or a man, may be accurately called a type; a sense no
less significant, but of more limited and transient application.
The tendency of a period,&mdash;especially when
one of marked transition,&mdash;its activities and its results,
not infrequently find expression in one or more histori<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>cal
characters. Such types may perhaps more accurately
be called personifications; the man or men
embodying, and in action realizing, ideas and processes
of thought, the progress of which is at the time united,
but is afterwards recognized as a general characteristic
of the period. Between the beginning and
the end a great change is found to have been effected,
which naturally and conveniently is associated with the
names of the most conspicuous actors; although they
are not the sole agents, but simply the most eminent.</p>

<p>It is in this sense more particularly that Hawke and
Rodney are presented as types. It might even be said
that they complement each other and constitute together
a single type; for, while both were men of unusually
strong personality, private as well as professional, and
with very marked traits of character, their great relation
to naval advance is that of men who by natural
faculty detect and seize upon incipient ideas, for which
the time is ripe, and upon the practical realization of
which the healthful development of the profession depends.
With these two, and with them not so much
contemporaneously as in close historical sequence, is
associated the distinctive evolution of naval warfare in
the eighteenth century; in their combined names is
summed up the improvement of system to which Nelson
and his contemporaries fell heirs, and to which Nelson,
under the peculiar and exceptional circumstances which
made his opportunity, gave an extension that immortalized
him. Of Hawke and Rodney, therefore, it
may be said that they are in their profession types of
that element of change, in virtue of which the profession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
grows; whereas the other four, eminent as they were,
exemplify rather the conservative forces, the permanent
features, in the strength of which it exists, and in the
absence of any one of which it droops or succumbs. It
does not, however, follow that the one of these great
men is the simple continuator of the other's work;
rather it is true that each contributed, in due succession
of orderly development, the factor of progress which his
day demanded, and his personality embodied.</p>

<p>It was not in the forecast of the writer, but in the
process of treatment he came to recognize that, like
Hawke and Rodney, the four others also by natural characteristics
range themselves in pairs,&mdash;presenting points
of contrast, in deficiencies and in excellencies, which
group them together, not by similarity chiefly, but as complementary.
Howe and Jervis were both admirable general
officers; but the strength of the one lay in his tactical
acquirements, that of the other in strategic insight and
breadth of outlook. The one was easy-going and indulgent
as a superior; the other conspicuous for severity,
and for the searchingness with which he carried the
exactions of discipline into the minute details of daily
naval life. Saumarez and Pellew, less fortunate, did not
reach high command until the great days of naval warfare
in their period had yielded to the comparatively
uneventful occupation of girdling the enemy's coast with
a system of blockades, aimed primarily at the restriction
of his commerce, and incidentally at the repression of
his navy, which made no effort to take the sea on a
large scale. Under these circumstances the functions
of an admiral were mainly administrative; and if Sau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>marez
and Pellew possessed eminent capacity as general
officers on the battle-field, they had not opportunity to
prove it. The distinction of their careers coincides with
their tenure of subordinate positions in the organisms of
great fleets. With this in common, and differentiating
them from Howe and Jervis, the points of contrast are
marked. Saumarez preferred the ship-of-the-line, Pellew
the frigate. The choice of the one led to the duties of
a division commander, that of the other to the comparative
independence of detached service, of the partisan
officer. In the one, love of the military side of his calling
predominated; the other was, before all, the seaman.
The union of the two perfects professional character.</p>

<p>The question may naturally be asked,&mdash;Why, among
types of naval officers, is there no mention, other than
casual, of the name of Nelson? The answer is simple.
Among general officers, land and sea, the group to
which Nelson belongs defies exposition by a type, both
because it is small in aggregate numbers, and because
the peculiar eminence of the several members,&mdash;the
eminence of genius,&mdash;so differentiates each from his
fellows that no one among them can be said to represent
the others. Each, in the supremacy of his achievement,
stands alone,&mdash;alone, not only regarded as towering
above a brilliant surrounding of distinguished followers,
but alone even as contrasted with the other great ones
who in their own day had a like supremacy. Such do
not in fact form a class, because, though a certain community
of ideas and principles may be traced in their
actions, their personalities and methods bear each the
stamp of originality in performance; and where origi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>nality
is found, classification ceases to apply. There is a
company, it may be, but not a class.</p>

<p>The last four biographies first appeared as contributions
to the "Atlantic Monthly," in 1893 and 1894. I
desire to return to the proprietors my thanks for their
permission to republish. The original treatment has
been here considerably modified, as well as enlarged. I
am also under special obligation to Mr. Fleetwood Hugo
Pellew, who gave me the photograph of Lord Exmouth,
with permission also to reproduce it. It represents that
great officer at the age most characteristic of his particular
professional distinction, as by me understood.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<h4 class="smcap">Naval Warfare at the Beginning of the Eighteenth Century</h4>

<p>The recent close of the nineteenth century
has familiarized us with the thought that
such an epoch tends naturally to provoke an
estimate of the advance made in the various
spheres of human activity during the period
which it terminates. Such a reckoning, however,
is not a mere matter of more and less, of comparison
between the beginning and the end,
regardless of intermediate circumstances. The
question involved is one of an historical process,
of cause and effect; of an evolution, probably
marked, as such series of events commonly are,
by certain salient incidents, the way-marks of
progress which show the road traversed and the
succession of stages through which the past has
become the present. Frequently, also, such development
associates itself not only with conspicuous
events, but with the names of great men,
to whom, either by originality of genius or by
favoring opportunity, it has fallen to illustrate in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
action the changes which have a more silent
antecedent history in the experience and reflection
of mankind.</p>

<p>The development of naval warfare in the
eighteenth century, its advance in spirit and
methods, is thus exemplified in certain striking
events, and yet more impressively is identified
with the great names of Hawke and Rodney.
The period of nearly half a generation intervened
between their births, but they were contemporaries
and actors, though to no large extent associates,
during the extensive wars that occupied
the middle of the century&mdash;the War of the Austrian
Succession, 1739-1748, and the Seven
Years War, 1756-1763. These two conflicts
are practically one; the same characteristic jealousies
and motives being common to both, as
they were also to the period of nominal peace,
but scarcely veiled contention, by which they were
separated. The difference of age between the
two admirals contributed not only to obviate rivalry,
by throwing their distinctive activities into
different generations, but had, as it were, the
effect of prolonging their influence beyond that
possible to a single lifetime, thus constituting it
into a continuous and fruitful development.</p>

<p>They were both successful men, in the ordinary
acceptation of the word success. They were
great, not only in professional character, but in
the results which do not always attend professional
desert; they were great in achievement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Each name is indissolubly linked with a brilliant
victory, as well as with other less known but
equally meritorious actions; in all of which the
personal factor of the principal agent, the distinctive
qualities of the commander-in-chief,
powerfully contributed and were conspicuously
illustrated. These were, so to say, the examples,
that enforced upon the men of their day the professional
ideas by which the two admirals were
themselves dominated, and upon which was forming
a school, with professional standards of action
and achievement destined to produce great
effects.</p>

<p>Yet, while this is so, and while such emphatic
demonstrations by deeds undoubtedly does more
than any other teaching to influence contemporaries,
and so to promote professional development,
it is probably true that, as a matter of historical
illustration, the advance of the eighteenth century
in naval warfare is more clearly shown by two great
failures, for neither of which were these officers
responsible, and in one only of which in fact did
either appear, even in a subordinate capacity.
The now nearly forgotten miscarriage of Admiral
Mathews off Toulon, in 1744, and the
miserable incompetency of Byng, at Minorca, in
1756, remembered chiefly because of the consequent
execution of the admiral, serve at least,
historically, to mark the low extreme to which
had then sunk professional theory and practice&mdash;for
both were there involved. It is, however, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
only as a point of departure from which to estimate
progress that these battles&mdash;if they deserve
the name&mdash;are historically useful. Considered
as the plane to which exertion, once well directed
and virile, had gradually declined through the
prevalence of false ideals, they link the seventeenth
century to the eighteenth, even as the
thought and action&mdash;the theory and practice&mdash;of
Hawke and Rodney uplifted the navy from
the inefficiency of Mathews and Byng to the
crowning glories of the Nile and Trafalgar, with
which the nineteenth century opened. It is thus,
as the very bottom of the wave, that those singular
and signal failures have their own distinctive
significance in the undulations of the onward
movement. On the one hand they are not unaccountable,
as though they, any more than the
Nile and Trafalgar, were without antecedent of
cause; and on the other they serve, as a background
at least, to bring out the figures of the
two admirals now before us, and to define their
true historical import, as agents and as exponents,
in the changes of their day.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, important to the comprehension
of the changes effected in that period of
transition, for which Hawke and Rodney stand,
to recognize the distinctive lesson of each of
these two abortive actions, which together may
be said to fix the zero of the scale by which
the progress of the eighteenth century is denoted.
They have a relation to the past as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
as to the future, standing far below the level
of the one and of the other, through causes that
can be assigned. Naval warfare in the past, in
its origin and through long ages, had been waged
with vessels moved by oars, which consequently,
when conditions permitted engaging at all, could
be handled with a scope and freedom not securable
with the uncertain factor of the wind. The
motive power of the sea, therefore, then resembled
essentially that of the land,&mdash;being human
muscle and staying power, in the legs on shore
and in the arms at sea. Hence, movements by
masses, by squadrons, and in any desired direction
corresponding to a fixed plan, in order to
concentrate, or to outflank,&mdash;all these could be
attempted with a probability of success not predicable
of the sailing ship. Nelson's remarkable
order at Trafalgar, which may almost be said
to have closed and sealed the record of the sail
era, began by assuming the extreme improbability
of being able at any given moment to
move forty ships of his day in a fixed order
upon an assigned plan. The galley admiral
therefore wielded a weapon far more flexible and
reliable, within the much narrower range of its
activities, than his successor in the days of sail;
and engagements between fleets of galleys accordingly
reflected this condition, being marked not
only by greater carnage, but by tactical combinations
and audacity of execution, to which the
sailing ship did not so readily lend itself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>When the field of naval warfare became extended
beyond the Mediterranean,&mdash;for long
centuries its principal scene,&mdash;the galley no
longer met the more exacting nautical conditions;
and the introduction of cannon, involving
new problems of tactics and ship-building,
accelerated its disappearance. The traditions of
galley-fighting, however, remained, and were reinforced
by the habits of land fighting,&mdash;the same
men in fact commanding armies on shore and
fleets at sea. In short, a period of transition
ensued, marked, as such in their beginnings
are apt to be, by an evident lack of clearness
in men's appreciation of conditions, and of the
path of development, with a consequent confusion
of outline in their practice. It is not always
easy to understand either what was done, or what
was meant to be done, during that early sail era;
but two things appear quite certainly. There
is still shown the vehemence and determination
of action which characterized galley fighting,
visible constantly in the fierce effort to grapple
the enemy, to break his ranks, to confuse and
crush him; and further there is clear indication
of tactical plan on the grand scale, broad in outline
and combination, involving different&mdash;but
not independent&mdash;action by the various great
divisions of the fleet, each of which, in plan at
least, has its own part, subordinate but contributory
to the general whole.</p>

<p>The results, though not unimportant, were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
satisfactory, for men were compelled to see that
from various causes the huge numbers brought
upon the field lapsed into confusion, and that
battle, however well planned in large outline,
resolved itself into a mere mass of warring units
incoherently struggling one with another. There
was lack of proportion between effort exerted
and effect achieved. A period of systematization
and organization set in. Unwieldy numbers
were reduced to more manageable dimensions by
excluding ships whose size and strength did not
add to the efficiency of the order of battle; the
powers and limitations of those which remained
were studied, and certain simple tactical dispositions,
fitted to particular emergencies, were recognized
and adopted,&mdash;all tending to impart unity
of movement and action, and to keep the whole
in regulated order under the hand of the commander-in-chief,
free from confusion.</p>

<p>To this point there was improvement; but reaction,
as often, went too far. The change in
accepted ideas is emphatically shown by a comparison
of the Fighting Instructions of 1740 and
1756, when the crystallization of the system was
complete but disintegration had not yet begun,
with those issued in 1665 by the Duke of York,
afterwards James II., at the beginning of the second
of the three Anglo-Dutch Wars. His in turn
are directly deducible from others framed shortly
after the first war, in 1652-1654, when sail tactics
had not passed the stage of infancy, and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
still strongly affected by the galley tradition.
There is here found, on the one hand, the prescription
of the line of battle,&mdash;a single column
of ships formed in each other's wake,&mdash;with the
provision that if the enemy is to leeward, and
awaits attack, the headmost squadron of the British
shall steer for the headmost of the enemy's
ships. This accords with the general tenor of
the later Instructions; but there occurs elsewhere,
and previously, the direction that, when
the enemy is to windward, if the leading British
Squadron finds it can weather any considerable
part of them, it is to "tack and stand in, and
strive to divide the enemy's body," and that, "being
got to windward, is to bear down on those
ships to leeward of them," which have thus been
cut off.</p>

<p>The thing to be observed here is the separate,
but positive, initiative prescribed for a portion of
the fleet, with a view to divide the enemy, and
then concentrate the whole fleet upon the fraction
thus isolated. The British van takes a particular,
but not an independent, action; for the
other divisions contribute their part to the common
purpose. "The middle squadron is to keep
her wind, and to observe the motion of the
enemy's van, which" [that is, "which" action of
the middle squadron] "the last squadron&mdash;the
rear&mdash;is to second; and both of these squadrons
are to do their utmost to assist or relieve the first
squadron, that divided the enemy's fleet." Evi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>dently
here we have tactical combination in
order to decisive action; clearly contemplated
also beforehand, not merely by a capable individual
general, but by the consensus of professional
opinion which such a paper as the Fighting
Instructions necessarily reflects. The stamp of
the galley period is upon this: strenuous and
close battle, the piercing of the enemy's order, the
movement of the squadrons differentiated, in
order that they may in a real and effective sense
<i>combine</i>, instead of being merely <i>distributed</i>, as
they afterwards were by both the letter of the
later Instructions and the tradition by which
these became encrusted. Nor should there be
overlooked, in this connection, the discretion allowed
the centre and rear. They are to "keep
their wind;" an expression which leaves optional
whether to tack, or stand as they are, whether to
engage the separated enemies to windward or to
leeward, as occasion may offer, in support of the
van. The provisions of 1665 afterwards disappear.
In 1740, and even as late as 1781, they
are traceable only in certain colorless articles,
suggestive of the atrophied organs of a body
concerning whose past use physiologists may
speculate.</p>

<p>As in the restoration of sounder methods, with
which we shall be concerned, this degeneration of
ideals was a work of time. In June, 1666, the
British met with a severe check in the Four Days
Battle, in which Monk, a soldier, commanded in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
chief. This reverse is chiefly to be attributed to
antecedent strategic errors, which made a portion
only of the available British force bear the brunt
of the first three days; but, among the inevitable
criticisms, we find stress laid upon fighting in
line as essential to success. This insistence
upon the line as an effective instrument proceeded,
among others, from Sir William Penn, a
seaman, and was at that time in the direction of
professional advance. The line had not yet obtained
the general professional acceptance needed
to establish and utilize its indisputable value.
This process was gradual, but when effected it
followed the usual laws of human development;
from a valuable means, it became in men's estimation
an exaggerated necessity. It came to pass
in time that the line no longer existed for tactics,
but tactics for the line, in which they found their
consummation and end.</p>

<p>There intervened, however, a happier period,&mdash;one
of transition,&mdash;and in the third Anglo-Dutch
war, 1672-1674, we seem to find a close approach
to just proportion between regularity of formation
and decisive tactical purpose; in which the principle
of the line is recognized and observed, but
is utilized by professional audacity for definite
and efficient tactical action, aiming at conclusive
results. The finest exponent of this, the culminating
epoch of naval warfare in the seventeenth
century, is the Dutchman Ruyter, who, taken
altogether, was the greatest naval seaman of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
era, which may be roughly identified with the
reign of Charles II. After that, naval warfare
was virtually suspended for fifteen years, and
when resumed in the last decade of the century,
the traces of incipient degeneracy can already be
noted amid much brilliant performance. From
that time completeness of military achievement
became in men's minds less of an object than
accurate observance of rule, and in practice the
defensive consideration of avoiding disaster began
to preponderate over offensive effort for the destruction
of the enemy.</p>

<p>In the development of tactical science, the
French had played a leading part, as they usually
have where reflective mental processes and formal
evolution of ideas are concerned. Among admirals,
the greatest name of this later period is the
French Tourville, a master of the science of his
profession, and gifted with a personal courage of
the heroic type; while the leading exponent of
Tourville's ideas, as well as historian of his
achievements, was the French priest Paul Hoste,&mdash;chaplain
to his fleet, and the father of the systematic
treatment of naval evolutions. But with
Tourville's name is associated not only a high
level of professional management, but a caution
in professional action not far removed from
timidity, so that an impatient Minister of Marine
of his day and nation styled him "poltroon in
head, though not in heart." His powers were
displayed in the preservation and orderly move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>ment
of his fleet; in baffling, by sheer skill, and
during long periods, the efforts of the enemy to
bring him to action; in skilful disposition, when
he purposely accepted battle under disadvantage;
but under most favorable opportunities he failed
in measures of energy, and, after achieving partial
success, superfluous care of his own command
prevented his blows from being driven
home.</p>

<p>Tourville, though a brilliant seaman, thus not
only typified an era of transition, with which
he was contemporary, but foreshadowed the
period of merely formal naval warfare, precise,
methodical, and unenterprising, emasculated of
military virility, although not of mere animal
courage. He left to his successors the legacy
of a great name, but also unfortunately that of
a defective professional tradition. The splendid
days of the French Navy under Louis XIV.
passed away with him,&mdash;he died in 1701; but
during the long period of naval lethargy on the
part of the state, which followed, the French
naval officers, as a class, never wholly lost sight
of professional ideals. They proved themselves,
on the rare occasions that offered, before 1715
and during the wars of Hawke and Rodney, not
only gallant seamen after the pattern of Tourville,
but also exceedingly capable tacticians,
upon a system good as far as it went, but defective
on Tourville's express lines, in aiming
rather at exact dispositions and defensive security<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
than at the thorough-going initiative and persistence
which confounds and destroys the enemy.
"War," to use Napoleon's phrase, "was to be
waged without running risks." The sword was
drawn, but the scabbard was kept ever open
for its retreat.</p>

<p>The English, in the period of reaction which
succeeded the Dutch wars, produced their own
caricature of systematized tactics. Even under
its influence, up to 1715, it is only just to say
they did not construe naval skill to mean anxious
care to keep one's own ships intact. Rooke, off
Malaga, in 1704, illustrated professional fearlessness
of consequences as conspicuously as he had
shown personal daring in the boat attack at
La Hougue; but his plans of battle exemplified
the particularly British form of inefficient naval
action. There was no great difference in aggregate
force between the French fleet and that
of the combined Anglo-Dutch under his orders.
The former, drawing up in the accustomed line
of battle, ship following ship in a single column,
awaited attack. Rooke, having the advantage
of the wind, and therefore the power of engaging
at will, formed his command in a similar and
parallel line a few miles off, and thus all stood
down together, the ships maintaining their line
parallel to that of the enemy, and coming into
action at practically the same moment, van to
van, centre to centre, rear to rear. This ignored
wholly the essential maxim of all intelligent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
warfare, which is so to engage as markedly to
outnumber the enemy at a point of main collision.
If he be broken there, before the remainder
of his force come up, the chances all are that
a decisive superiority will be established by this
alone, not to mention the moral effect of partial
defeat and disorder. Instead of this, the impact
at Malaga was so distributed as to produce a
substantial equality from one end to the other
of the opposing fronts. The French, indeed, by
strengthening their centre relatively to the van
and rear, to some extent modified this condition
in the particular instance; but the fact does
not seem to have induced any alteration in
Rooke's dispositions. Barring mere accident,
nothing conclusive can issue from such arrangements.
The result accordingly was a drawn
battle, although Rooke says that the fight, which
was maintained on both sides "with great fury
for three hours, ... was the sharpest day's service
that I ever saw;" and he had seen much,&mdash;Beachy
Head, La Hougue, Vigo Bay, not to
mention his own great achievement in the capture
of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>This method of attack remained the ideal&mdash;if
such a word is not a misnomer in such a case&mdash;of
the British Navy, not merely as a matter of
irreflective professional acceptance, but laid down
in the official "Fighting Instructions." It cannot
be said that these err on the side of lucidity; but
their meaning to contemporaries in this partic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>ular
respect is ascertained, not only by fair inference
from their contents, but by the practical
commentary of numerous actions under commonplace
commanders-in-chief. It further received
authoritative formulation in the specific finding
of the Court-Martial upon Admiral Byng, which
was signed by thirteen experienced officers.
"Admiral Byng should have caused his ships
to tack together, and should immediately have
borne down upon the enemy; his van steering
for the enemy's van, his rear for its rear, each
ship making for the one opposite to her in the
enemy's line, under such sail as would have
enabled the worst sailer to preserve her station in
the line of battle." Each phrase of this opinion
is a reflection of an article in the Instructions.
The line of battle was the naval fetich of the day;
and, be it remarked, it was the more dangerous
because in itself an admirable and necessary
instrument, constructed on principles essentially
accurate. A standard wholly false may have its
error demonstrated with comparative ease; but
no servitude is more hopeless than that of unintelligent
submission to an idea formally correct,
yet incomplete. It has all the vicious misleading
of a half-truth unqualified by appreciation of
modifying conditions; and so seamen who disdained
theories, and hugged the belief in themselves
as "practical," became <i>doctrinaires</i> in the
worst sense.</p>

<p>It would seem, however, that a necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
antecedent to deliverance from a false conception,&mdash;as
from any injurious condition,&mdash;is a
practical illustration of its fallacy. Working consequences
must receive demonstration, concrete
in some striking disastrous event, before improvement
is undertaken. Such experience is painful
to undergo; but with most men, even in their
private capacity, and in nearly all governmental
action where mere public interests are at stake,
remedy is rarely sought until suffering is not
only felt, but signalized in a conspicuous incident.
It is needless to say that the military professions
in peace times are peculiarly liable to this apathy;
like some sleepers, they can be awakened only
by shaking. For them, war alone can subject
accepted ideas to the extreme test of practice. It
is doubtless perfectly true that acquaintance with
military and naval history, mastery of their teachings,
will go far to anticipate the penalty attaching
to truth's last argument&mdash;chastisement; but
imagination is fondly impatient of warning by
the past, and easily avails itself of fancied or
superficial differences in contemporary conditions,
to justify measures which ignore, or even
directly contravene, ascertained and fundamental
principles of universal application.</p>

<p>Even immediate practical experience is misinterpreted
when incidents are thus viewed through
the medium of a precedent bias. The Transvaal
War, for instance, has afforded some striking
lessons of needed modifications, consequent upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
particular local factors, or upon developments in
the material of war; but does any thoughtful military
man doubt that imagination has been actively
at work, exaggerating or distorting, hastily waiving
aside permanent truth in favor of temporary
prepossessions or accidental circumstance? It is
at least equally likely that the naval world at
the present time is hugging some fond delusions
in the excessive size and speed to which battle-ships
are tending, and in the disproportionate
weight assigned to the defensive as compared to
the offensive factors in a given aggregate tonnage.
Imagination, theory, <i>a priori</i> reasoning, is
here at variance with rational historical precedent,
which has established the necessity of numbers
as well as of individual power in battle-ships, and
demonstrated the superiority of offensive over
defensive strength in military systems. These&mdash;and
other&mdash;counterbalancing considerations
have in past wars enforced the adoption of a
medium homogeneous type, as conducive both to
adequate numbers,&mdash;which permit the division
of the fleet when required for strategic or tactical
purposes,&mdash;and also directly to offensive fleet
strength by the greater facility of manoeuvring
possessed by such vessels; for the strength of a
fleet lies not chiefly in the single units, but in their
mutual support in elastic and rapid movement.
Well tested precedent&mdash;experience&mdash;has here
gone to the wall in favor of an untried forecast
of supposed fundamental change in conditions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
But experience is uncommonly disagreeable when
she revenges herself after her own fashion.</p>

<p>The British Navy of the eighteenth century in
this way received an unpleasant proof of the
faultiness of its then accepted conclusions, in the
miscarriages of Mathews off Toulon, in 1744,
and of Byng off Minorca, in 1756. So fixed were
men's habits of thought that the lessons were not
at once understood. As evidenced by the distribution
of censure, the results were attributed
by contemporary judges to particular incidents
of each battle, not to the erroneous underlying
general plans, contravening all sound military
precedent, which from the first made success
improbable, indeed impossible, except by an
inefficiency of the enemy which was not to be
presumed. These battles therefore are important,
militarily, in a sense not at all dependent upon
their consequences, which were ephemeral. They
are significant as extreme illustrations of incompetent
action, deriving from faulty traditions;
and they have the further value of showing the
starting point, the zero of the scale, from which
the progress of the century is to be measured.
In describing them, therefore, attention will be
given chiefly to those circumstances which exhibit
the shackles under which fleet movements
then labored, not only from the difficulties inherent
to the sea and sailing ships, but from the
ideas and methods of the times. Those incidents
also will be selected which show how false stan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>dards
affected particular individuals, according to
their personal characteristics.</p>

<p>In Admiral Mathews' action, in February,
1744, an allied fleet composed of sixteen French
ships-of-the-line and twelve Spanish lay in Toulon,
waiting to sail for a Spanish port. The
British, in force numerically equal, were at
anchor under the Hy&egrave;res Islands, a few miles to
the eastward. They got underway when the
allied movement began on February 20th; but
anchored again for the night, because the enemy
that day came no farther than the outer road of
Toulon. The next morning the French and
Spaniards put to sea with a wind at first westerly,
and stretched to the southward in long, single
column, the sixteen French leading. At 10 A.M.
the British followed, Vice-Admiral Lestock's
division taking the van; but the wind, shifting
to east, threw the fleet on the port tack, on which
the rear under Rear-Admiral Rowley had to lead.
It became necessary, therefore, for this division
and the centre to pass Lestock, which took some
time with the light airs prevailing. Two or
three manoeuvres succeeded, with the object of
forming the fighting order, a column similar and
parallel to that of the enemy, and to get closer to
him. When night fell a signal was still flying
for the line abreast, by which, if completed, the
ships would be ranged on a line parallel to the
allies, and heading towards them; consequently
abreast of each other. It would then need only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
a change of course to place them in column, sides
to the enemy; which, as before said, was the fighting
order&mdash;the "line of battle."</p>

<p>The line abreast, however, was not fully formed
at dark. Therefore the admiral, in order to hasten
its completion, soon afterwards made a night signal,
with lanterns, for the fleet to bring-to,&mdash;that
is, bring their sides to the wind, and stop. He
intended thereby that the ships already in station
should stand still, while the others were gaining
their places, all which is a case of simple evolution,
by land as by sea. It was contended by the
admiral that Vice-Admiral Lestock's division was
then too far to the right and rear, and hence too
distant from the enemy, and that it was his duty
first to get into his station and then to bring-to.
To this the vice-admiral on his trial replied, first,
that he was not out of his station; and, second,
that if he were, the later signal, to bring-to, suspended
the earlier, to form line abreast, and that
it was therefore his business, without any discretion,
to stop where he was. Concerning the first
plea, a number of witnesses, very respectable in
point of rank and opportunity for seeing, testified
that the vice-admiral did bring-to three or four
miles to the right and rear of his place in the
line abreast, reckoning his station from the admiral's
ship; yet, as the Court peremptorily rejected
their evidence, it is probably proper to accept the
contemporary decision as to this matter of fact.</p>

<p>But as regards the second plea, being a matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of military correctness, a difference of opinion is
allowable. The Court adopted as its own the
argument of the vice-admiral. Without entering
here into a technical discussion, the Court's ruling,
briefly stated, was that the second signal superseded
the first, so that, if the vice-admiral was in
the wrong place, it was not his duty to get into
the right before stopping; and that this was
doubly the case because an article of the Night
Signals (7) prescribed that, under the conditions
of the alleged offence, "a fleet sailing before the
wind, or nearly so, if the admiral made the signal
for the fleet to bring-to, the windward ships
should bring-to first." Therefore, if Lestock was
to windward, as the charge read, it was his duty
to bring-to first and at once. It is evident, however,
that even the Sailing Instructions, cast-iron
as they were, contemplated a fleet in order, not
one in process of forming order; and that to
bring-to helter-skelter, regardless of order, was to
obey the letter rather than the spirit. Muddle-headed
as Mathews seems to have been, what he
was trying to do was clear enough; and the duty
of a subordinate was to carry out his evident aim.
An order does not necessarily supersede its predecessor,
unless the two are incompatible. The
whole incident, from Lestock's act to the Court's
finding, is instructive as showing the slavish
submission to the letter of the Instructions; a
submission traceable not to the law merely, but
to the added tradition that had then fast hold of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
men's minds. It is most interesting to note that
the unfortunate Byng was one of the signers of
this opinion, as he was also one of the judges
that sentenced Mathews to be dismissed from the
navy, as responsible for the general failure.</p>

<p>During the night of the 21st the allies, who
had stopped after dark, appear again to have
made sail. Consequently, when day broke, the
British found themselves some distance astern and
to windward&mdash;northeast; the wind continuing
easterly. Their line, indifferently well formed in
van and centre, stretched over a length of nine
miles through the straggling of the rear. Lestock's
ship was six miles from that of Mathews,
whereas it should not have been more than two
and a half, at most, in ordinary sailing; for battle,
the Instructions allowed little over a half-mile.
Accepting the Court's finding that he was in
position at dark, this distance can only be attributed,
as Lestock argued and the Court
admitted, to a current&mdash;that most convenient
of scape-goats in navigation. The allies, too,
had a lagging rear body, five Spanish ships
being quite a distance astern; but from van to
rear they extended but six miles, against the
British nine. It was the distance of the British
rear, not straggling in van or centre, that constituted
this disadvantage.</p>

<p>Mathews wished to wait till Lestock reached
his place, but the allies were receding all the
time; and, though their pace was slackened to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
enable the five sternmost Spaniards to come up,
the space between the fleets was increasing. It
was the duty of the British admiral to force an
action, on general principles; but in addition he
believed that the French intended to push for
Gibraltar, enter the Atlantic, and join their Brest
fleet, in order to cover an invasion of England by
an army reported to be assembling at Dunkirk.
Clearly, therefore, something must be done; yet
to enter into a general engagement with near a
third of his command out of immediate supporting
distance was contrary to the accepted principles
of the day. The fleet was not extended
with that of the enemy, by which is meant that
the respective vans, centres, and rears were not
opposed; the British van being only abreast of
the allied centre, their centre of the allied rear,
Lestock tailing away astern and to windward,
while the dozen leading French were some distance
ahead of both bodies. Now the Fighting
Instructions required that, "If the admiral and
his fleet have the wind of the enemy, and they
have stretched themselves in a line of battle, the
van of the admiral's fleet is to steer with the
van of the enemies, and <i>there</i> to engage them."
There was no alternative course laid down; just
as there was no punishment alternative to death
in the Article of War under which Byng was
shot.</p>

<p>Yet the indications all were that to wait for
this most formal and pedantic disposition, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
ignored every principle of warfare, would be to
throw away the chance of battle. The French,
fresh from port and clean-bottomed, out-sailed
the bulk of the British, as did the Spaniards,
though to a less degree; and it was part of
Lestock's defence, admitted by the Court, that,
doing his utmost, his division, as a whole, certainly
could not get abreast the allied rear. Lestock,
indeed, directly submitted to the Court that
the commander-in-chief was at fault in not waiting
till his line was thus extended and formed, and
then all bearing down together, in line abreast;
although by his own contention no such issue
could have been reached that day, unless the
allies were obliging enough to wait. "I aver, and
I shall die in this opinion, that no man that is an
officer, who knows his duty, will make the signal
for line abreast to steer down upon an enemy,
until the fleet has been stretched and extended
in a line of battle, according to the 19th Article
of the Fighting Instructions. Can it be service,"
he adds, "to bear down so much unformed and
in confusion, that the van cannot possibly join
battle with, or engage the van of the enemy, the
centre with the centre, and the rear with the
rear?"</p>

<p>Mathews not being then on trial, the Court in
its finding did not reply directly to this question;
but indirectly it left no doubt as to its opinion.
"The Admiral, by bearing down as he did
upon the rear division of the combined fleet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
excluded the Vice-Admiral from any part of the
engagement, if he could have come up; for if
both lines had been closed, when the Admiral
engaged the <i>Real</i>, there would have been no
more than one ship of the enemy's fleet for
the Vice-Admiral and his whole division to have
engaged." Again, "It does not appear that the
Vice-Admiral was in any part the cause of the
miscarriage of his Majesty's fleet in the Mediterranean;
the <i>bringing on of the general engagement
according to the 19th Article</i> of the Fighting
Instructions ... not depending upon him."
Sixteen officers of the rank of captain and above
signed these opinions, and there is no denying
the words of the 19th Article; yet one wonders
to see no recognition of the necessity of using
your opportunity as you find it, of the moral
effect of an approaching reserve, which Lestock's
division would have constituted, of the part it
may take in improving or repairing the results of
an action&mdash;taking the place of injured friends,
preventing injured foes escaping, turning doubtful
battle into victory. But no; these commonplaces
of to-day and of all time were swamped by the
Fighting Instructions. It will be seen in the
sequel what a disastrous moral influence Lestock's
aloofness exercised upon a few timid captains, and
not improbably upon the entire subsequent course
and worst errors of his unfortunate superior.</p>

<p>One of the witnesses in the ensuing Courts-Martial
testified that the commander-in-chief,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
under these perplexing circumstances, went into
the stern gallery of the flag-ship <i>Namur</i>, and
called to Captain Cornwall of the <i>Marlborough</i>,
next astern, asking what he thought. Cornwall
replied he "believed they would lose the glory of
the day, if they did not attack the Spaniards,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the allied rear-centre and rear,&mdash;"the Vice-Admiral&mdash;Lestock&mdash;being
so far astern." To
which the admiral said, "If you'll bear down
and attack the <i>Real</i>,"&mdash;the <i>Real Felipe</i>, Spanish
flag-ship,&mdash;"I'll be your second." This was
about one o'clock, and the signal to engage had
been made two hours earlier, probably with the
double object of indicating the ultimate intention
of the movements in hand, and the immediate
urgency of forming the line. The admiral's
words betray the indecision of an irresolute
nature and of professional rustiness, but not of
timidity, and Cornwall's words turned the scale.
The course of the flag-ship <i>Namur</i> had hitherto
been but a little off the wind, "lasking" down,
to use the contemporary but long obsolete expression,
in such manner as to show the admiral's
desire to engage himself with the enemy's centre,
according to the Fighting Instructions; but now,
in hopelessness of that result, she kept broad
off, directly for the nearest enemy, accompanied
closely by the <i>Norfolk</i>, her next ahead, and by
the <i>Marlborough</i>. Rear-Admiral Rowley, commanding
the van, imitated the admiral's example,
bringing the French ship abreast him to close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
action. He also was thoroughly supported by
the two captains next astern of him, the second
of whom was Edward Hawke,&mdash;afterwards the
brilliant admiral,&mdash;in the <i>Berwick</i>. Two British
groups, each of three ships, were thus hotly
engaged; but with an interval between them of
over half a mile, corresponding to the places
open for six or seven other vessels. The conduct
of the ships named, under the immediate
influence of the example set by the two admirals,
suggests how much the average man is sustained
by professional tone; for a visible good example
is simply a good standard, a high ideal, realized
in action.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, just as Hawke's later
doings showed the man able to rise above the
level of prescribed routine duty, there was found
in the second astern of the <i>Namur</i> a captain
capable of exceptional backwardness, of reasoning
himself into dereliction of clear duty, and
thus effecting a demonstration that the example
of timidity is full as contagious and more masterful
than that of audacity. The flag-ships and
their supporters ranged themselves along the
hostile line to windward, within point-blank
range; according to the 20th Article of the
Fighting Instructions, which read, "Every Commander
is to take care that his guns are not fired
till he is sure he can reach the enemy upon a
point-blank; and by no means to suffer his guns
to be fired over any of our own ships." The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
point-blank is the range of a cannon laid level,
and the requirement was necessary to efficient
action in those days of crude devices for pointing,
with ordnance material of inferior power. Even
sixty years later Nelson expressed his indifference
to improvements in pointing, on the ground that
the true way of fighting was to get so close that
you could not miss your aim. Thus Mathews'
captain placed the <i>Namur</i>, of ninety guns, within
four hundred yards&mdash;less than quarter of a mile&mdash;of
the Spanish flag-ship, the <i>Real Felipe</i>,
of one hundred and ten guns; and Cornwall
brought the <i>Marlborough</i> immediately in the
wake of the <i>Namur</i>, engaging the Spanish <i>Hercules</i>.
But the <i>Dorsetshire</i>, which should have
followed the <i>Marlborough</i>, was stopped by her
commander, Captain George Burrish, at a distance
which was estimated by several witnesses
to be from half a mile to nearly a mile from the
enemy, or, to use a very expressive phrase then
current, "at random shot." The Court-Martial,
however, in pronouncing upon this point, decided
that inasmuch as a bar-shot came on board the
<i>Dorsetshire</i> in this early part of the engagement,
she must be construed to have brought to within
extreme point-blank. In view of the mass of
testimony to the greater distance, this seems to
have been simply giving the benefit of a doubt.</p>

<p>Thus situated, the action between the <i>Namur</i>
and <i>Marlborough</i> on the one side, and the <i>Real
Felipe</i> and <i>Hercules</i> on the other, was for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
time very hot; but the <i>Marlborough</i>, moving
faster than the <i>Namur</i>, closed upon her, so that
she had to get out of the way, which she did by
moving ahead and at the same time hauling to
windward, till she reached as far from the Spanish
line as the <i>Dorsetshire</i> had remained. The
Court in this matter decided that, after the
admiral had thus hauled off, the <i>Dorsetshire</i> was
in a line, or as far to leeward&mdash;towards the
enemy&mdash;as the admiral. The <i>Marlborough</i> was
thus left alone, exposed to the fire of a ship
heavier than herself, and also to that of the
<i>Hercules</i>, which was able to train upon her a
considerable part of her battery. Under these
circumstances, it was the duty of the <i>Dorsetshire</i>,
as it was the opportunity of her commander, by
attacking the <i>Hercules</i>, to second, and support,
the engaged ship; but she continued aloof.
After two hours&mdash;by 3 P.M.&mdash;the main and
mizzen masts were cut out of the <i>Marlborough</i>,
and she lost her captain with forty-two men
killed, and one hundred and twenty wounded,
out of a crew of seven hundred and fifty. Thus
disabled, the sails on the foremast turned her
head towards the enemy, and she lay moving
sluggishly, between the fleets, but not under control.
The admiral now sent an officer to Burrish&mdash;the
second that morning&mdash;to order him
into his station and to support the <i>Marlborough</i>;
while to the latter, in response to an urgent representation
by boat of her condition, and that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
was threatened by the approach of the hitherto
separated ships of the Spanish rear, he replied
that the <i>Namur</i> was wearing and would come to
her assistance.</p>

<p>When Burrish received his message, he sent for
his lieutenants on the quarter-deck, and spoke to
them words which doubtless reflect the reasoning
upon which he was justifying to himself his most
culpable inaction. "Gentlemen, I sent for you
to show you the position of our ships to windward,"
(<i>i.e.</i> the ships of the centre division
behind him, and Lestock's division), "likewise
those five sail [Spanish] of the enemy that are
astern of us. I have my orders to engage the
<i>Real</i>, and you see I am bearing down for that
purpose." The lieutenants remarked that he
could do so with safety. To this he rejoined,
with a curtness that testifies to the uneasiness of
his mind, "I did not send for you to ask your
opinions, but only to observe that not one of our
ships is coming down to my assistance, in order
to cut those five sail off, and in case those five
sail should oblige me to haul my wind again, and
leave the <i>Marlborough</i>, that you may be able to
indemnify my conduct, if called in question."
One witness also testified that he "was angry
that Admiral Lestock's division did not bear
down,"&mdash;which was just enough,&mdash;and that "he
thought it most advisable to keep his station;"
meaning by this, apparently, to remain where he
was. His cross-examination of the evidence was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
directed to prove the danger to his ship from
these remaining Spaniards. This anxiety was
wholly misplaced, and professionally unworthy.
Quite independent of orders by signal and message,
he was bound, in view of the condition of
the <i>Marlborough</i>, to go to her relief, and to assume
that the three English ships of the centre
division, in his rear, would surely sustain him.
To base contrary action upon a doubt of their
faithfulness was to condemn himself. Four ships
to five under such conditions should be rather
a spur than a deterrent to an officer of spirit, who
understands the obligation of his calling.</p>

<p>Till this, the <i>Dorsetshire</i> had been under her
three topsails only. She appears then to have
stood down under more sail, but very slowly, and
here occurred another disaster which was largely
chargeable to her being out of her station. Seeing
the desperate state of the <i>Marlborough</i>,
Mathews, who throughout managed blunderingly,
with the single exception of the original
attack, had thought to aid her and divert the fire
of the <i>Real</i> by sending against the latter a fire-ship.
It was elementary that vessels of this class
needed energetic support and cover in their desperate
work. Small in size, of no battery-force
except against boat attacks, loaded with combustibles
and powder, success in the use of them
under an enemy's guns required not only imperturbable
coolness and nerve, but the utmost
attainable immunity from the attention of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
enemy. This could be secured only by a heavy
and sustained fire from their own fleet. With
the <i>Norfolk</i>, <i>Namur</i>, <i>Marlborough</i>, and <i>Dorsetshire</i>
in close line, as they should have been, and
heavily engaged, a fire-ship might have passed
between them, and, though at imminent hazard
even so, have crossed the four hundred yards of
intervening water to grapple the hostile flag-ship;
but with the <i>Marlborough</i> lying disabled and
alone, the admiral himself acting with indecision,
and the <i>Dorsetshire</i> hanging aloof, the attempt
was little short of hopeless. Still it was made,
and the <i>Anne Galley</i>&mdash;such was her odd name&mdash;bore
down, passing close by the <i>Dorsetshire</i>.</p>

<p>It became doubly the duty of Burrish to act,
to push home whatever demonstration was in
his power to make; the fire-ship, however, went
by him and was permitted to pursue her desperate
mission without his support. The <i>Real</i>,
seeing the <i>Anne</i> approach, bore up out of
her line, and at the same time sent a strongly-manned
launch to grapple and tow her out of
the way. This was precisely one of the measures
that it was the business of supporting ships to
repel. The captain of the fire-ship, thrown upon
his own resources, opened fire, a most hazardous
measure, as much of his priming was with loose
powder; but the launch readily avoided injury
by taking position directly ahead, where the guns
would not bear. The crew of the <i>Anne</i> were
now ordered into the boat, except the captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and five others, who were to remain to the last
moment, and light the train; but from some
cause not certainly demonstrated she exploded
prematurely, being then within a hundred yards
of the <i>Real</i>. It is necessary to say that the
Court-Martial acquitted Burrish of blame, because
he "had no orders to cover the fire-ship, either
by signal or otherwise." Technically, the effect
of this finding was to shift an obvious and gross
blunder from the captain to some one else; but
it is evident that if the <i>Dorsetshire</i> had occupied
her station astern of the <i>Marlborough</i>,
the fire-ship's attempt would have been much
facilitated.</p>

<p>The Court decided unanimously that Burrish
"ought to have borne down as far to leeward
as where the admiral first began to engage,
notwithstanding that the admiral might be
hauled off before the <i>Dorsetshire</i> got so far to
leeward." The point upon which the line should
have been formed was thus established by the
Court's finding. The subsequent proceedings
of this ship need not be related. She now came
slowly into close action, but that part of the
enemy's order was already broken, and their rear
vessels, the fear of which had controlled her
captain, passed by as they came up without
serious action.</p>

<p>How far Burrish's example influenced the
captains immediately behind him cannot certainly
be affirmed. Such shyness as he displayed is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
not only infectious, but saps that indispensable
basis upon which military effectiveness reposes,
namely, the certainty of co-operation and support,
derived from mutual confidence, inspired by military
discipline, obedience, and honor. It is well
to note here that the remoteness of Lestock's
division thus affected Burrish, who evidently
could not understand either its distance or its
failure to approach, and who, being what he
was, saw himself threatened with want of that
backing which he himself was refusing to the
<i>Marlborough</i>. While he was blaming Lestock,
hard things were being said about him in Lestock's
division; but the lesson of Lestock's influence
upon Burrish is not less noteworthy
because the latter forfeited both duty and
honor by his hesitation. It is to be feared that
the captain of the <i>Essex</i>, following the <i>Dorsetshire</i>,
was a coward; even so Burrish, an old
captain, certainly did not cheer his heart by
good example, but rather gave him the pretext
for keeping still farther off. The rearmost two
ships of the division but confirm the evidences
of demoralization, and the more so that their
captains seem from the evidence to have been
well-disposed average men; but the five Spanish
vessels approaching, with the <i>Dorsetshire</i> and
the <i>Essex</i> holding aloof, was too much for their
resolution&mdash;and not unnaturally. The broad
result, however, was lamentable; for four British
ships feared to come to the aid of an heroic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and desperately injured consort, in deadly peril,
because five enemies were drawing nigh.</p>

<p>Upon these four therefore fell, and not unjustly,
the weight of national anger. Burrish
was cashiered, and declared forever incapable
of being an officer in the Navy. Norris, of the
<i>Essex</i>, absconded to avoid trial. The two others
were pronounced unfit to command, but, although
never again employed, mitigating circumstances
in their behavior caused them to be retained
on the lists of the Navy. It is not too much
to say that they were men just of the stamp
to have escaped this shame and ruin of reputation,
under more favorable conditions of professional
tone.</p>

<p>Concerning the vice-admiral's action at this
time, which had its share in the ruin of these
captains, another curious instance of men's bondage
to the order of battle transpires. The three
rear ships of his squadron were clean, that is,
relatively fast; and they were rearmost for this
very reason of speed, because, when the division
led on the other tack, they, as headmost ships of
the fleet, would be ready to chase. Nevertheless,
when the admiral sent to Lestock in the forenoon
to hurry him into line, no order was given
to these ships to press ahead. Why? Lestock
answers that to send those ships ahead, out of
the place in the line prescribed to them by the
commander-in-chief, was breaking the line, which
should expose him to condign punishment; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
this opinion the Court also adopts: "The [only]
messages sent to the Vice-Admiral by the Admiral's
two lieutenants were to make what sail
he possibly could, and to close the line with his
division; no signal was made for him to chase
with his division, or send ships of his division
to chase; without which, <i>while the signal for the
line of battle was flying</i>, and more especially after
the messages brought him, he could not, <i>without
breach of duty</i>, either have chased or sent ships
to chase out of the line." It is to be noted that
the word "chase" is here used in the strictest
technical sense, not merely to exclude Lestock
from diverting a ship to some other purpose than
that of the engagement, but even from shifting
her place in the general order in the view of
furthering the engagement; for the Court says
again: "The Vice-Admiral could not send any
ships of his division to the relief of the <i>Namur</i>
and <i>Marlborough without breaking the order of
battle</i>, there being four ships of the Admiral's
division" (to wit, the <i>Dorsetshire</i> and that crowd)
"stationed between the Vice-Admiral's division
and the <i>Marlborough</i>, which four ships might
have gone to the assistance of the <i>Marlborough</i>."</p>

<p>The second in command thus had no liberty
to repair either the oversights of his superior, or
the results of obvious bad conduct in juniors; for
Burrish's backwardness was observed throughout
the rear. There was a long road yet to travel
to Nelson's personal action at St. Vincent and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Copenhagen, or to his judicious order at Trafalgar,
"The Second in command will, after my
intentions are made known to him, have the
entire direction of his line." Even that great
officer Hood, off the Chesapeake in 1781, felt
himself tied hand and foot by the union flag at
the mizzen peak,&mdash;the signal for the line. Only
the commander-in-chief could loose the bonds;
either by his personal initiative alone, and vigilant
supervision, as did Hawke and Rodney, or
by adding to this the broad view of discretion in
subordinates which Nelson took. Before leaving
this subject, note may be taken of a pettifogging
argument advanced by Lestock and adopted by
the Court, that orders to these three ships to press
ahead would have resulted in nothing, because of
the lightness of the wind then and afterwards.
True, doubtless, and known after the fact; but
who before the event could predict the uncertain
Mediterranean breeze, or how much each foot
gained might contribute to the five minutes
which measure the interval between victory and
defeat. It is not by such lagging hesitations
that battles are won.</p>

<p>It is a trivial coincidence, though it may be
noted in passing, that as it was the second astern
of the commander-in-chief on whom fell the
weight of the disgrace, so it was the second
astern of the commander of the van who alone
scored a distinct success, and achieved substantial
gain of professional reputation. Hawke, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
first bearing down, had come to close action with
the Spanish <i>Neptuno</i>, a vessel nominally of less
force than his own ship, the <i>Berwick</i>. The <i>Neptuno</i>
was at length driven out of her line, with a
loss of some two hundred killed and wounded.
Thus left without an immediate antagonist,
Hawke's attention was attracted by another
Spanish vessel, the <i>Poder</i>, of the same nominal
force as the <i>Neptuno</i>, and following her in the
order; with which four or five of the seven British
ships, that should have closed the interval between
Mathews and Rowley, were carrying on a distant
and circumspect engagement, resembling in caution
that of the <i>Dorsetshire</i> and her followers.
He carried the <i>Berwick</i> close alongside the new
enemy, dismasted her, and after two hours compelled
her to strike her flag; the only vessel in
either fleet that day to surrender, and then only
after a resistance as honorable to Spain as that
of the <i>Marlborough</i> had been to Great Britain.
Her commander refused to yield his sword to
any but Hawke, who also took possession of the
prize with a party from his own ship; thus establishing
beyond dispute, by all customary formalities,
his claim to the one trophy of the day. The
occurrences through which she was afterwards
lost to the British, so that only the honor of the
capture remained, and that to Hawke alone,
must be briefly told; for they, too, are a part of
the mismanagement that has given to this battle
its particular significance in naval history.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>As the unlucky fire-ship bore down, Mathews
began wearing the <i>Namur</i>,&mdash;turning her round,
that is, from the wind, and therefore towards the
<i>Marlborough</i> and her opponents. In this he
seems to have had first in view supporting the
fire-ship and covering the <i>Marlborough</i>. Boats
were ahead of the latter towing her from the
enemy. As she was thus being dragged off, but
after the fire-ship blew up, the <i>Namur</i> passed
between her and the hostile line; then, hauling
to the wind on the starboard tack, she stood north
towards Lestock's division. This movement to
the rear was imitated by the British ships of
the centre,&mdash;the <i>Dorsetshire</i> and others,&mdash;and,
beyond a brush with the rear five Spanish vessels
as they came up, the action in the centre here
ceased.</p>

<p>This retrograde movement of Mathews and his
division drew the centre away from the van. At
about the same time the allied van, composed
wholly of French ships, seeing the straits of the
<i>Poder</i> and the <i>Real</i>, tacked&mdash;turned round&mdash;to
come down to their assistance. This imposed a
like movement upon the British van, lest it should
be engaged apart from the rest of the fleet, and
perhaps doubled on, by a number of perfectly
fresh ships. The <i>Poder</i>, having lost her chief
spars, could not be carried off, nor was Hawke
able even to remove the men he had thrown
on board. She was therefore retaken by the
French. Lieutenant Lloyd, the officer in charge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
escaped with a part of the prize crew, taking with
him also a number of Spanish prisoners; but a
junior lieutenant and some seamen were left
behind and captured. The <i>Berwick</i> being compelled
to follow her division, Lloyd could not
rejoin her till the following day, and sought
refuge for that night on board another ship.</p>

<p>The next day, February 23d, Mathews had
another chance. As he did not pursue during
the night, while the allies continued to retire, he
was a long way off at daylight; but his fleet was
now united, and the enemy retreating. He need
therefore have no anxiety about the crippled
<i>Marlborough</i>, but could follow freely; whereas,
the enemy being pursued, their injured ships both
retarded the movement and were endangered. In
the course of the day, the <i>Poder</i> had lagged so far
behind that Admiral Rowley, who had recognized
Hawke's enterprise the day before, directed him
to move down upon her. As he approached, the
French ship in company abandoned her, but in
taking possession Hawke was anticipated by the
<i>Essex</i>, which Mathews himself had ordered to do
so. The captain of the <i>Essex</i> got hold of the
Spanish flag, with some other small trophies,
which he afterwards refused to give up unless
compelled; and, as Mathews would not give an
order, Hawke never got them. Thus curiously
it came to pass that the one man who above
several misdemeanants distinguished himself by
bad conduct, amounting to cowardice, and who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
ran away to escape trial, kept the tokens of the
single achievement of the day from him whose
valor had won them. The <i>Poder</i> herself was set
on fire, and destroyed.</p>

<p>The British fleet continued to follow during
the 23d, and at nightfall was within three or
four miles of the enemy, when Mathews again
stopped. The allies, continuing to withdraw,
were next morning nearly out of sight, and
further pursuit was abandoned.</p>

<p>Thus ended this almost forgotten affair, which
in its day occasioned to an unusual degree the
popular excitement and discussion which always
follow marked disaster, and but rarely attend
success. Besides the particular missteps of Lestock
and the individual captains, which have been
mentioned, Mathews's conduct was marked by
serious failures in professional competency. The
charge preferred against him which seems most
to have attracted attention, and to have been
considered most damaging, was taking his fleet
into action in a confused and disorderly manner.
It is significant of professional standards that
this should have assumed such prominence; for,
however faulty may have been his previous management,
the most creditable part of his conduct
was the manner of his attack. He did not wait
for a pedantically accurate line, but by a straightforward
onslaught, at a favorable moment, upon
a part of the enemy,&mdash;and that the rear,&mdash;set
an example which, had it been followed by all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
who could do so, would probably have resulted
in a distinct and brilliant success. He was justified&mdash;if
he reasoned at all&mdash;in expecting that
Lestock could get into action as soon as the
French van; or, at the least, before it could
reverse the conditions which would have ensued
from a vigorous encounter upon the lines of
Mathews's attack. It is most doubtful, indeed,
whether the French van would have ventured to
engage, in the case supposed; for the French
admiral, writing to the French ambassador in
Spain, used these words: "It is clear, in the
situation I was in, it could not be expected that
a French admiral should go to the assistance of
the Spaniards; neither could the vanguard of the
fleet do it without running the hazard of being
surrounded by the vanguard of the English,
which had the wind of them; but <i>as soon as the
English left me</i> I drew together all the ships of
both squadrons, and sailed immediately to the
assistance of the <i>Real Felipe</i>, in doing which I
was exposed to the fire of the whole English
line; but happily the English did not punish my
<i>rashness</i> as it deserved." Evidently De Court
shared to the full the professional caution which
marked the French naval officers, with all their
personal courage; for if it was rash to pass the
hostile line after it wore, it would be reckless to
do so before.</p>

<p>Considered simply as a tactical situation, or
problem, quite independent of any tactical fore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>thought
or insight on the part of the commander-in-chief,&mdash;of
which there is little indication,&mdash;the
conditions resulting from his attack were well
summed up in a contemporary publication, wholly
adverse to Mathews in tone, and saturated with
the professional prepossessions embodied in the
Fighting Instructions. This writer, who claims
to be a naval officer, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The whole amount of this fight is that the centre,
consisting of eleven ships-of-the-line, together with two
of-the-line and two fifty-gun ships of the Rear-Admiral's
division [the van], <i>were able to destroy</i> the whole Spanish
squadron, much more so as three of those ships went
on with the French [the allied van], and four of the
sternmost did not get up with their admiral before it
was darkish, long after the fire-ship's misfortune, so that
the whole afternoon there were only five, out of which
the <i>Constante</i> was beat away in less than an hour; what
then fifteen ships could be doing from half an hour
past one till past five, no less than four hours, and these
ships not taken, burnt, and destroyed, is the question
which behooves them to answer."</p></div>

<p>In brief, then, Mathews's attack was so delivered
that the weight of thirteen of-the-line fell upon
five Spanish of the same class, the discomfiture of
which, actually accomplished even under the misbehavior
of several British ships, separated the
extreme rear, five other Spanish vessels, from the
rest of the allies. Whatever the personal merit
or lack of merit on the part of the commander-in-chief,
such an opportunity, pushed home by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
"band of brothers," would at the least have wiped
out these rear ten ships of the allies; nor could
the remainder in the van have redeemed the situation.
As for the method of attack, it is worthy
of note that, although adopted by Mathews
accidentally, it anticipated, not only the best general
practice of a later date, but specifically the
purpose of Rodney in the action which he himself
considered the most meritorious of his whole
career,&mdash;that of April 17, 1780. The decisive
signal given by him on that occasion, as explained
by himself, meant that each ship should steer,
not for the ship corresponding numerically to
her in the enemy's order, but for the one immediately
opposite at the time the signal was made.
This is what Mathews and his seconds did, and
others should have imitated. Singularly enough,
not only was the opportunity thus created lost,
but there is no trace of its existence, even, being
appreciated in such wise as to affect professional
opinion. As far as Mathews himself was concerned,
the accounts show that his conduct,
instead of indicating tactical sagacity, was a
mere counsel of desperation.</p>

<p>But after engaging he committed palpable and
even discreditable mistakes. Hauling to
windward&mdash;away&mdash;when the <i>Marlborough</i> forced
him ahead, abandoned that ship to overwhelming
numbers, and countenanced the irresolution of
the <i>Dorsetshire</i> and others. Continuing to stand
north, after wearing on the evening of the battle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
was virtually a retreat, unjustified by the conditions;
and it would seem that the same false step
gravely imperilled the <i>Berwick</i>, Hawke holding
on, most properly, to the very last moment of
safety, in order to get back his prize-crew.
Bringing-to on the night of the 23d was an error
of the same character as standing north during
that of the 22d. It was the act of a doubtful,
irresolute man,&mdash;irresolute, not because a coward,
but because wanting in the self-confidence that
springs from conscious professional competency.
In short, the commander-in-chief's unfitness was
graphically portrayed in the conversation with
Cornwall from the quarter gallery of the flag-ship.
"If you approve and will go down with me, I will
go down." Like so many men, he needed a
backer, to settle his doubts and to stiffen his backbone.
The instance is far from unique.</p>

<p>In the case of Byng, as of Mathews, we are not
concerned with the general considerations of the
campaign to which the battle was incidental. It
is sufficient to note that in Minorca, then a British
possession, the French had landed an army of
15,000 men, with siege artillery sufficient to
reduce the principal port and fortress, Port
Mahon; upon which the whole island must fall.
Their communications with France depended
upon the French fleet cruising in the neighborhood.
Serious injury inflicted upon it would
therefore go far to relieve the invested garrison.</p>

<a href="images/fp048-fr.jpg">Full-resolution image</a>
</div>

<p>Under these circumstances the British fleet
sighted Minorca on the 19th of May, 1756, and
was attempting to exchange information with the
besieged, when the French fleet was seen in the
southeast. Byng stood towards it, abandoning
for the time the effort to communicate. That
night both fleets manoeuvred for advantage of
position with regard to the wind. The next day,
between 9 and 10 A.M., they came again in view
of each other, and at 11 were about six miles apart,
the French still to the southeast, with a breeze
at south-southwest to southwest. The British
once more advanced towards them, close hauled
on the starboard tack, heading southeasterly, the
enemy standing on the opposite tack, heading
westerly, both carrying sail to secure the weather
gage (B1, F1). It appeared at first that the French
would pass ahead of the British, retaining the
windward position; but towards noon the wind
changed, enabling the latter to lie up a point or
two higher (B2). This also forced the bows of
the several French vessels off their course, and put
them out of a regular line of battle; that is, they
could no longer sail in each other's wake (F2).
Being thus disordered, they reformed on the
same tack, heading northwest, with the wind very
little forward of the beam. This not only took
time, but lost ground to leeward, because the
quickest way to re-establish the order was for the
mass of the fleet to take their new positions from
the leewardmost vessel. When formed (F3), as
they could not now prevent the British line from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
passing ahead, they hove-to with their main-topsails
aback,&mdash;stopped,&mdash;awaiting the attack,
which was thenceforth inevitable and close at
hand.</p>

<p>In consequence of what has been stated, the
British line (B2-B3)&mdash;more properly, column&mdash;was
passing ahead of the French (F2-F3), steering
towards their rear, in a direction in a general
sense opposite to theirs, but not parallel; that is,
the British course made an angle, of between
thirty and forty-five degrees, with the line on
which their enemy was ranged. Hence, barring
orders to the contrary,&mdash;which were not given,&mdash;each
British ship was at its nearest to the enemy
as she passed their van, and became more and more
distant as she drew to the rear. It would have
been impossible to realize more exactly the postulate
of the 17th Article of the Fighting
Instructions, which in itself voiced the ideal conditions
of an advantageous naval position for
attack, as conceived by the average officer of
the day; and, as though most effectually to
demonstrate once for all how that sort of
thing would work, the adjunct circumstances
approached perfection. The admiral was thoroughly
wedded to the old system, without an
idea of departing from it, and there was a fair
working breeze with which to give it effect,
for the ships under topsails and foresail would
go about three knots; with top-gallant sails, perhaps
over four. A fifty-gun ship, about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
middle of the engagement, had to close her
lower deck ports when she set her top-gallant
sails on the wind, which had then freshened
a little.</p>

<p>The 17th Article read thus: "If the admiral
see the enemy standing towards him, and he
has the wind of them, the van of the fleet
is to make sail till they come the length of
the enemy's rear, and our rear abreast of the
enemy's van; then he that is in the rear of
our fleet is to tack first, and every ship one
after another as fast as they can throughout
the whole line; and if the admiral will have
the whole fleet to tack together, the sooner to
put them in a posture of engaging the enemy,
he will hoist" a prescribed signal, "and fire
a gun; and whilst they are in fight with the
enemy the ships will keep at half a cable's
length&mdash;one hundred yards&mdash;one of the other."
All this Byng aimed to do. The conditions exactly
fitted, and he exactly followed the rules, with
one or two slight exceptions, which will appear,
and for which the Court duly censured him.</p>

<p>When thus much had been done, the 19th
Article in turn found its postulate realized, and
laid down its corresponding instruction: "If the
admiral and his fleet have the wind of the
enemy, and they have stretched themselves in
a line of battle, the van of the admiral's fleet
is to <i>steer with</i> the van of the enemy's, and
there to engage with them." The precise force<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of "steer with" is not immediately apparent to
us to-day, nor does it seem to have been perfectly
clear then; for the question was put to the
captain of the flag-ship,&mdash;the heroic Gardiner,&mdash;"You
have been asked if the admiral did not
express some uneasiness at Captain Andrews"&mdash;of
the van ship in the action&mdash;"not seeming
to understand the 19th Article of the Fighting
Instructions; Do not you understand that article
to relate to our van particularly when the two
fleets are [already] in a parallel line of battle to
each other?" (As TT, F3). <i>Answer</i>: "I apprehended
it in the situation" [not parallel] "we were
in<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> if the word <i>For</i> were instead of the word
<i>With</i>, he would, I apprehend, have steered directly
<i>for</i> the van ship of the Enemy." <i>Question</i>. "As
the 19th Article expresses to steer with the
van of the enemy, if the leading ship had done
so, in the oblique line we were in with the
enemy, and every ship had observed it the same,
would it not have prevented our rear coming to
action at all, at least within a proper distance?"
<i>Answer</i>: "Rear, and van too." "Steer with"
therefore meant, to the Court and to Gardiner,
to steer parallel to the enemy,&mdash;possibly likewise
abreast,&mdash;and if the fleets were already
parallel the instruction would work; but neither
the articles themselves, nor Byng by his signals,
did anything to effect parallelism before making
the signal to engage.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>The captain of the ship sternmost in passing,
which became the van when the fleet tacked
together according to the Instructions and
signals, evidently shared Gardiner's impression;
when about, he steered parallel to&mdash;"with"&mdash;the
French, who had the wind nearly abeam.
The mischief was that the ships ahead of him
in passing were successively more and more
distant from the enemy, and if they too, after
tacking, steered with the latter, they would never
get any nearer. The <i>impasse</i> is clear. Other
measures doubtless would enable an admiral
to range his fleet parallel to the enemy at any
chosen distance, by taking a position himself and
forming the fleet on his ship; or, in this particular
instance, Byng being with the van as it, on
the starboard tack, was passing the enemy
(B3 B3), could at any moment have brought his
fleet parallel to the French by signalling the
then van ship to keep away a certain amount,
the rest following in her wake. Nothing to
that effect being in the Instructions, it seems
not to have occurred to him. His one idea was
to conform to them, and he apprehended that
after tacking, as they prescribed, the new van
ship would bear down and engage without
further orders, keeping parallel to the French
when within point-blank, the others following
her as they could; a process which, from the
varying distances, would expose each to a concentrated
fire as they successively approached.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Byng's action is only explicable to the writer
by supposing that he thus by "steer with"
understood "steer for;" for when, after the fleet
tacked together, the new van ship (formerly the
rear) did not of her own motion head for the
leading enemy, he signalled her to steer one
point, and then two points, in that direction.
This, he explained in his defence, was "to put
the leading captain in mind of his Instructions,
who I perceived did not steer away with the
enemy's leading ship agreeable to the 19th Article
of the Fighting Instructions." The results
of these orders not answering his expectations,
he then made the signal to engage, as the only
remaining way perceptible to him for carrying
out the Instructions.</p>

<p>To summarize the foregoing, up to the moment
the signal for battle was made: While the fleets
were striving for the weather gage, the wind had
shifted to the southwest. The French, momentarily
disordered by the change, had formed in line
ahead about noon, heading northwest, westerly, so
as just to keep their main topsails aback and the
ships with bare steerage way, but under command
(F3). The British standing south-southeast, by the
wind, were passing (B2-B3) across the head of the
enemy's fleet at a distance of from three to two
miles&mdash;the latter being the estimate by their
ships then in the rear. The French having
twelve vessels in line and the British thirteen, the
gradual progress of the latter should bring their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
then van "the length of the enemy's rear," about
the time the rear came abreast of his van. When
this happened, the Instructions required that the
fleet tack together, and then stand for the enemy,
ship to ship, number one to number one, and so
along the line till the number twelves met<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>This Byng purposed to do, but, unluckily for
himself, ventured on a refinement. Considering
that, if his vessels bore down when abreast their
respective antagonists, they would go bows-on,
perpendicularly, subject to a raking&mdash;enfilading&mdash;fire,
he deferred the signal to tack till his van
had passed some distance beyond the French rear,
because thus they would have to approach in a
slanting direction. He left out of his account here
the fact that all long columns tend to straggle in
the rear; hence, although he waited till his three
or four leading ships had passed the enemy
before making signal to tack, the rear had got no
farther than abreast the hostile van. Two of the
clearest witnesses, Baird of the <i>Portland</i>, next to
the then rear ship, and Cornwall of the <i>Revenge</i>,
seventh from it, testified that, after tacking
together, to the port tack, when they kept away
for the enemy in obedience to the signal for
battle, it was necessary, in order to reach their
particular opponents, to bring the wind not only
as far as astern, but on the starboard quarter,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>showing that they had been in rear of their station
before tacking, and so too far ahead after it;
while Durell of the <i>Trident</i>, ninth from rear and
therefore fifth from van, asserted that at the
same moment the British van, which after tacking
became the rear, had overpassed the enemy by
five or six ships. This may be an exaggeration,
but that three or four vessels had gone beyond
is proved by evidence from the ships at that end
of the line.</p>

<p>The Court therefore distinctly censured the
admiral for this novelty: "Unanimously, the
Court are of opinion that when the British fleet
on the starboard tack were stretched abreast, <i>or
about the beam</i> of the enemy's line, the admiral
should have tacked the fleet all together, and
immediately have conducted it on a direct course
for the enemy, the van steering for the enemy's
van," etc. The instructive point, however, is not
Byng's variation, nor the Court's censure, but the
idea, common to both, that the one and only way
to use your dozen ships under the conditions was
to send each against a separate antagonist. The
highest and authoritative conception of a fleet
action was thus a dozen naval duels, occurring
simultaneously, under initial conditions unfavorable
to the assailant. It is almost needless to
remark that this is as contrary to universal military
teaching as it was to the practice of Rodney,
Howe, Jervis, and Nelson, a generation or two
later.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>This is, in fact, the chief significance of this
action, which ratified and in a measure closed the
effete system to which the middle eighteenth
century had degraded the erroneous, but comparatively
hearty, tradition received by it from
the seventeenth. It is true, the same blundering
method was illustrated in the War of 1778.
Arbuthnot and Graves, captains when Byng was
tried, followed his plan in 1781, with like demonstration
of practical disaster attending false
theory; but, while the tactical inefficiency was
little less, the evidence of faint-hearted professional
incompetency, of utter personal inadequacy,
was at least not so glaring. It is the
combination of the two in the person of the
same commander that has given to this action its
pitiful pre-eminence in the naval annals of the
century.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not so much to point out the
lesson, as to reinforce its teaching by the exemplification
of the practical results, that there is
advantage in tracing the sequel of events in this
battle. The signal to tack was made when the
British van had reached beyond the enemy's
rear, at a very little after 1 P.M. (B3). This reversed
the line of battle, the rear becoming the
van, on the port tack. When done, the new
van was about two miles from that of the
French (F4); the new rear, in which Byng was
fourth from sternmost, was three and a half or
four from their rear. Between this and 2 P.M.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
came the signals for the ship then leading to keep
two points, twenty-five degrees, more to starboard,&mdash;towards
the enemy; a measure which could
only have the bad effect of increasing the angle
which the British line already made with that
of the French, and the consequent inequality of
distance to be traversed by their vessels in reaching
their opponents. At 2.20 the signal for battle
was made, and was repeated by the second in
command, Rear-Admiral Temple West, who was
in the fourth ship from the van. His division of
six bore up at once and ran straight down before
the wind, under topsails only, for their several
antagonists; the sole exception being the van-most
vessel, which took the slanting direction
desired by Byng, with the consequence that she
got ahead of her position, had to back and to
wear to regain it, and was worse punished than
any of her comrades. The others engaged in
line, within point-blank, the rear-admiral hoisting
the flag for close action (B4). Fifteen minutes
later, the sixth ship, and rearmost of the van,
the <i>Intrepid</i>, lost her foretopmast, which crippled
her.</p>

<p>The seventh ship, which was the leader of the
rear, Byng's own division, got out of his hands
before he could hold her. Her captain, Frederick
Cornwall, was nephew to the gallant fellow who
fell backing Mathews so nobly off Toulon, and
had then succeeded to the command of the <i>Marlborough</i>,
fighting her till himself disabled. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
had to bring the wind on the starboard quarter
of his little sixty-four, in order to reach the seventh
in the enemy's line, which was an eighty-gun
ship, carrying the flag of the French admiral.
This post, by professional etiquette, as by evident
military considerations, Byng owed to his own
flag-ship, of equal force.</p>

<p>The rest of the rear division the commander-in-chief
attempted to carry with himself, slanting
down; or, as the naval term then had it, "lasking"
towards the enemy. The flag-ship kept
away four points&mdash;forty-five degrees; but hardly
had she started, under the very moderate canvas
of topsails and foresail, to cover the much greater
distance to be travelled, in order to support the
van by engaging the enemy's rear, when Byng
observed that the two ships on his left&mdash;towards
the van&mdash;were not keeping pace with him. He
ordered the main and mizzen topsails to be backed
to wait for them. Gardiner, the captain, "took
the liberty of offering the opinion" that, if sail
were increased instead of reduced, the ships concerned
would take the hint, that they would all
be sooner alongside the enemy, and probably
receive less damage in going down. It was a
question of example. The admiral replied, "You
see that the signal for the line is out, and I am
ahead of those two ships; and you would not
have me, as admiral of the fleet, run down as if
I was going to engage a single ship. It was Mr.
Mathews's misfortune to be prejudiced by not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
carrying his force down together, which I shall
endeavor to avoid." Gardiner again "took the liberty"
of saying he would answer for one of the two
captains doing his duty. The incident, up to the
ship gathering way again, occupied less than ten
minutes; but with the van going down headlong&mdash;as
it ought&mdash;one ceases to wonder at the
impression on the public produced by one who
preferred lagging for laggards to hastening to
support the forward, and that the populace suspected
something worse than pedantry in such
reasoning at such a moment. When way was
resumed, it was again under the very leisurely
canvas of topsails and foresail.</p>

<p>By this had occurred the incident of the <i>Intrepid</i>
losing her foretopmast. It was an ordinary
casualty of battle, and one to be expected; but
to such a temper as Byng's, and under the
cast-iron regulations of the Instructions, it
entailed consequences fatal to success in the
action,&mdash;if success were ever attainable under
such a method,&mdash;and was ultimately fatal to
the admiral himself. The wreck of the fallen
mast was cleared, and the foresail set to maintain
speed, but, despite all, the <i>Intrepid</i> dropped
astern in the line. Cornwall in the <i>Revenge</i>
was taking his place at the moment, and fearing
that the <i>Intrepid</i> would come back upon him,
if in her wake, he brought up first a little
to windward, on her quarter; then, thinking
that she was holding her way, he bore up again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
At this particular instant he looked behind, and
saw the admiral and other ships a considerable
distance astern and to windward; much Lestock's
position in Mathews's action. This was
the stoppage already mentioned, to wait for the
two other ships. Had Cornwall been Burrish,
he might in this have seen occasion for waiting
himself; but he saw rather the need of the
crippled ship. The <i>Revenge</i> took position on
the <i>Intrepid's</i> lee quarter, to support her against
the enemy's fire, concentrated on her when her
mast was seen to fall. As her way slackened,
the <i>Revenge</i> approached her, and about fifteen
minutes later the ship following, the <i>Princess
Louisa</i>,&mdash;one of those for which Byng had
waited,&mdash;loomed up close behind Cornwall, who
expected her to run him on board, her braces
being shot away. She managed, however, with
the helm to back her sails, and dropped clear;
but in so doing got in the way of the vessel
next after her, the <i>Trident</i>, which immediately
preceded Byng. The captain of the <i>Trident</i>,
slanting down with the rest of the division,
saw the situation, put his helm up, ran under
the stern of the <i>Louisa</i>, passed on her lee side,&mdash;nearest
the enemy,&mdash;and ranged up behind
the <i>Revenge</i>; but in doing this he not only
crossed the stern of the <i>Louisa</i>, but the bow
of the admiral's ship&mdash;the <i>Ramillies</i>.</p>

<p>Under proper management the <i>Ramillies</i>
doubtless could have done just what the <i>Trident</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
did,&mdash;keep away with the helm, till the ships
ahead of her were cleared; she would be at
least hasting towards the enemy. But the noise
of battle was in the air, and the crew of the
<i>Ramillies</i> began to fire without orders, at an
improper distance. The admiral permitted them
to continue, and the smoke enveloping the ship
prevented fully noting the incidents just narrated.
It was, however, seen before the firing
that the <i>Louisa</i> was come up into the wind
with her topsails shaking, and the <i>Trident</i> passing
her to leeward. There should, therefore,
have been some preparation of mind for the
fact suddenly reported to the admiral, by a
military passenger on the quarter deck, that
a British ship was close aboard, on the lee bow.
It was the <i>Trident</i> that had crossed from windward
to leeward for the reasons given, and an
instant later the <i>Louisa</i> was seen on the weather
bow. Instead of keeping off, as the <i>Trident</i>
had done, the admiral ordered the foresail hauled
up, the helm down, luffed the ship to the wind,
and braced the fore-topsail sharp aback; the
effect of which was first to stop her way, and
then to pay her head off to leeward, clear of
the two vessels. About quarter of an hour
elapsed, by Captain Gardiner's evidence, from
the time that the <i>Ramillies's</i> head pointed clear
of the <i>Trident</i> and <i>Louisa</i> before sail was again
made to go forward to aid the van. The battle
was already lost, and in fact had passed out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of Byng's control, owing to his previous action;
nevertheless this further delay, though probably
due only to the importance attached by the
admiral to regularity of movement, had a discreditable
appearance.</p>

<p>The Court held that the admiral was justified
in not trying to go to leeward of the two ships,
under the circumstances when they were seen;
but blamed him for permitting the useless cannonade
which prevented seeing them sooner.
The results at this moment in other parts of
the field should be summarized, as they show
both the cause and the character of the failures
due to faulty management.</p>

<p>The five ships of the British van had already
seen their adversaries withdraw after a sharp
engagement. This seems to have been due to
the fact that two were individually overmatched
and driven off; whereupon the other three
retired because unable to contend with five.
But no support reached the British van at
this important moment; on the contrary, the
British rear was now two or three miles distant,
astern and to windward. The lagging of the
crippled <i>Intrepid</i> held back the <i>Revenge</i>. Cornwall
was detained some time by the old idea
that he needed a signal to pass her, because
to do so was breaking the order established by
the admiral; but concluding at last that Byng
was unaware of the conditions, and seeing that
his immediate opponent&mdash;the French admiral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>&mdash;was
drawing ahead, he sent word to the
<i>Intrepid</i> to hold her fire for a few moments
till he could go by. He then made sail.</p>

<p>The French rear with its commander-in-chief
had been watching the incidents narrated: the
crippling of the <i>Intrepid</i>, the consequent disorder
in the British rear, and the increasing distance
between it and the van. When the <i>Revenge</i>,
however, passed ahead, and Byng disentangled
his flag-ship, the moment for a decisive step
arrived. The French rear vessels were nearer
the British van than Byng's division was. They
now filled their topsails, made more sail, stood
for the British leading ships, already partially
unrigged, passed by, and in so doing gave them
the fire of a number of substantially fresh vessels,
which had undergone only a distant and ineffective
cannonade. Byng saw what was about to
happen, and also set more canvas; but it was no
longer possible to retrieve the preceding errors.
The French admiral had it in his power very
seriously to damage, if not to destroy the hostile
van; but in accordance with the tradition of his
nation he played an over-prudent game, strictly
defensive, and kept too far off. After exchanging
distant broadsides, he steered northwest towards
Mahon, satisfied that he had for the time
disabled his opponent. The British that evening
tacked off-shore and stood to the southeast.
Four days later they abandoned the field, returning
to Gibraltar. The fall of Minorca followed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing could have been much worse than the
deplorable management of this action on the part
of the commander-in-chief. It is a conspicuous
instance of weak and halting execution, superimposed
upon a professional conception radically
erroneous; and it reflected throughout the timid
hesitancy of spirit which dictated the return to
Gibraltar, under the always doubtful sanction of
a Council of War. But the historical value of
the lesson is diminished if attention is confined
to the shortcomings of the admiral, neglectful
of the fact that his views as to the necessity
to observe the routine of the Fighting Instructions
are reproduced in the evidence of the
captains; and that the finding of the Court
censures, not the general idea, but certain details,
important yet secondary. Durell, being asked
whether the admiral could not have passed under
the stern of the <i>Trident</i>, as the <i>Trident</i> had
under that of the <i>Louisa</i>, replies, "Yes, but she
would have been to leeward of those ships
ahead;" that is, to leeward of the line. Gardiner
"knows no other method than what the
admiral took, for preserving the line regular."
Cornwall cannot pass the <i>Intrepid</i> without a
signal, because it would be breaking the order.
These were all good men.</p>

<p>The Court, composed of four admirals and
nine captains, the junior of whom had over ten
years seniority, give in their finding no shadow
of disapproval to the broad outlines of the action.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
There can be, therefore, no doubt about service
standards. The questions put to the witnesses
reveal indeed a distinct preference for forming
the line of battle <i>parallel</i> to that of the enemy
before bearing down, so that all the ships may
have the same distance to go, have a clear field
ahead of each, and the comparatively simple
mutual bearing of "abeam" to observe; but it
refrains from censuring the admiral for forming
on a line very oblique to that of the enemy,
which entailed the burden of changing the relative
positions during standing down, so as to
arrive all together, on a line parallel to his; while
the course itself being oblique alike to their own
front and the enemy's, each preceding ship was
liable to get in the way, "to prove an impediment,"
to its follower,&mdash;as actually happened.
It was indeed impossible to fault the commander-in-chief
in this particular, because his action was
conformable to the letter of the Instructions,
with which he was evidently and subserviently
eager to comply.</p>

<p>The decision of the Court therefore was, in
substance, that in bearing down upon the enemy
Byng did not do wrong in starting upon a line
oblique to them; but that he should have steered
such a course, and maintained such spread of
sail, graduated to the speed of the slowest ship in
the fleet, that all should reach point-blank range
at the same time, and be then ranged on a
line parallel to that of the enemy. "When on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the starboard tack, the admiral should have
tacked the fleet all together and immediately conducted
it on a direct course for the enemy; ... each ship
steering for her opposite ship in the
enemy's line, and under such sail as might have
enabled the worst sailing ship, under all her plain
sail, to preserve her station." It is needless to
insist with any naval man, or to any soldier, that
such an advance, in orderly fashion, oblique to
the front, is unattainable except by long drill,
while this fleet had been but a few weeks assembled;
and the difficulty is enhanced when each
ship has not only to keep its station in line, but
to reach a particular enemy, who may not be just
where he ought, having respect to the British
order. The manoeuvre favored by the Court for
the fleet as a whole was in fact just that which
Byng attempted for his own division, with the
results that have been narrated. These were
aggravated by his mismanagement, but did not
originate from it.</p>

<p>The invariable result of an attack thus attempted,
however vigorously made, was that the
van of the assailant got into action first, receiving
the brunt of the enemy's fire without proper support.
Not infrequently, it also underwent a
second hammering from the enemy's rear, precisely
in the same way as occurred in Byng's
action; and whether this happened or not depended
more upon the enemy than upon the
British rear. In ignoring, therefore, the idea of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
combining an attack in superior numbers upon
a part of the enemy, and adopting instead that of
an onslaught upon his whole, all along the line,
the British practice of the eighteenth century
not only surrendered the advantage which the
initiative has, of effecting a concentration, but
subjected their own fleets to being beaten in
detail, subject only to the skill of the opponent
in using the opportunity extended to him. The
results, at best, were indecisive, tactically considered.
The one apparent exception was in
June, 1794, when Lord Howe, after long vainly
endeavoring a better combination with a yet raw
fleet, found himself forced to the old method;
but although then several ships were captured,
this issue seems attributable chiefly to the condition
of the French Navy, greatly fallen through
circumstances foreign to the present subject. It
was with this system that Rodney was about to
break, the first of his century formally to do so.
A false tactical standard, however, was not the
only drawback under which the British Navy
labored in 1739. The prolonged series of wars,
which began when the establishment of civil
order under Cromwell permitted the nation to
turn from internal strife to external interests, had
been for England chiefly maritime. They had
recurred at brief intervals, and had been of such
duration as to insure a continuity of experience
and development. Usage received modification
under the influence of constant warlike practice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and the consequent changes in methods, if not
always thoroughly reasoned, at the least reflected
a similar process of professional advance in the
officers of the service. This was consecutively
transmitted, and by the movement of actual war
was prevented from stagnating and hardening
into an accepted finality. Thus the service and
its officers, in the full performance of their functions,
were alive and growing. Nor was this all.
The same surroundings that promoted this
healthful evolution applied also a continual test
of fitness to persons. As each war began, there
were still to be found in the prime of vigor and
usefulness men whose efficiency had been proved
in its predecessor, and thus the line of sustained
ability in leadership was carried on from one
naval generation to another, through the sixty-odd
years, 1652-1713, over which these conditions
extended.</p>

<p>The peace of Utrecht in 1713 put an end to
this period. A disputed succession after the
death of Queen Anne, in 1714, renewed the condition
of internal disquietude which had paralyzed
the external action of England under Charles I.;
and this co-operated with the mere weariness of
war, occasioned by prolonged strife, to give both
the country and the navy a temporary distaste to
further military activity. The man of the occasion,
who became the exponent and maintainer
of this national inclination, was Sir Robert Walpole;
to whom, during his ministry of over twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
years, can fairly be applied Jefferson's phrase
concerning himself, that his "passion was peace."
But, whatever the necessity to the country of
such a policy, it too often results, as it did in both
these cases, in neglect of the military services,
allowing the equipment to decay, and tending to
sap the professional interest and competency of
the officers.</p>

<p>From this last evil the United States Navy in
Jefferson's day was saved by the simple fact that
the officers were young men, or at the most in
the early prime of life,&mdash;the Navy itself, in 1812,
being less than twenty years old as a corporate
organization. The British Navy of 1739 was in
very different case. For a quarter of a century
the only important military occurrence had been
the Battle of Cape Passaro, in 1718, where the
British fleet in a running fight destroyed a much
inferior Spanish force; and the occasion then
was not one of existent war, but of casual hostilities,
which, precipitated by political conditions,
began and ended with the particular incident, as
far as the sea was concerned. Back of this lay
only Malaga, in 1704; for the remaining years of
war, up to 1713, had been unmarked by fleet
battles. The tendency of this want of experience,
followed by the long period&mdash;not of peace only,
but&mdash;of professional depression resultant upon
inactivity and national neglect, was to stagnation,
to obviate which no provision existed or was
attempted. Self-improvement was not a note of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the service, nor of the times. The stimulus of
occupation and the corrective of experience being
removed, average men stuck where they were,
and grew old in a routine of service, or, what was
perhaps worse, out of the service in all but name.
In naval warfare, the Battle of Malaga, the last
point of performance, remained the example, and
the Fighting Instructions the passively accepted
authority. The men at the head of the Navy, to
whom the country naturally looked, either had no
record&mdash;no proof of fitness&mdash;because but youths
in the last war, or else, in simple consequence of
having then had a chance to show themselves,
were now superannuated. This very fact, however,
had the singular and unfortunate result that,
because the officers of reputation were old, men
argued, by a curious perversion of thought, that
none but the old should be trusted.</p>

<p>Of this two significant cases will tell more
than many words. Mathews, who commanded at
Toulon in 1744, was then sixty-seven years old,
and had not been at sea between 1724 and 1742.
Hawke, in 1747, when he had already established
an excellent reputation as a captain, and for enterprise
in recent battle, was thought young to be
entrusted with a squadron of a dozen ships-of-the-line,
although he was forty-two,&mdash;two years older
than Nelson at the Nile, but four years younger
than Napoleon and Wellington at Waterloo, and
one year less in age than Grant at the close of
the American Civil War. Such instances are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of merely curious interest; they are symptoms of
professional states of mind, of a perplexity and
perversion of standards which work disastrously
whenever war succeeds to a prolonged period of
peace, until experience has done its work by
sorting out the unsound from among the fair-seeming,
and has shown also that men may be
too old as well as too young for unaccustomed
responsibility. The later prevalence of juster
views was exemplified in the choice of Wolfe,
who was but thirty-two when he fell before
Quebec in 1759, charged with one of the most
difficult enterprises that had then been entrusted
to a British general.</p>

<p>It is these two factors, therefore, an erroneous
standard and a lethargic peace, which principally
caused the weakness of the British official
staff for battle service at the period of
lowest descent, which was reached in the first
quarter of the eighteenth century, but was prolonged
and intensified by a protracted interval
of professional apathy. Other grievous evils
doubtless existed, serious defects in administration,
involving indifferent equipment, bad and
scanty provisions, inferior physique in the ships'
companies, and wretched sanitary arrangements;
but while all these unquestionably gravely affected
general efficiency for war, they belonged rather
to the civil than the military side of the profession.
In the hour of battle it was not these,
but the tone and efficiency of the officers, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
chiefly told. A false pattern of action had been
accepted at a moment favorable to its perpetuation,
when naval warfare on the grand scale had
ceased, owing to the decline of the principal
enemy, the navy of France; while the average
competency of naval officers had been much lowered
through want of professional incentive, and
the absence of any sifting process by which the
unfit could be surely eliminated. That plenty of
good material existed, was sufficiently shown by
the number of names, afterwards distinguished,
which soon began to appear. Weeding went on
apace; but before its work was done, there had to
be traversed a painful period, fruitful of evidences
of unfitness, of personal weakness, of low or false
professional ideas.</p>

<p>It is with this period that we have first had to
do as our point of departure, by which not only
to estimate the nature and degree of the subsequent
advance, but to illustrate also the part
specifically contributed to it by Hawke and
Rodney, through their personal and professional
characteristics. While types, they are more than
mere exponents of the change as a whole, and
will be found to bear to it particular relations,&mdash;its
leaders in fact, as well as in name. It is
not merely fanciful to say that Hawke stands
for and embodies the spirit of the new age,
while Rodney rather exemplifies and develops
the form in which that spirit needed ultimately
to cloth itself in order to perfect its working.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
The one is a protest in act against the professional
faintheartedness, exaggerated into the
semblance of personal timidity, shown by the captains
off Toulon in 1774; the other, in the
simple but skilful methods and combinations
adopted by him, both represents and gives effect
to a reaction against the extravagant pedantry,
which it fell to Byng, in all the honesty of
a thoroughly commonplace man, to exhibit in
unintentional caricature.</p>

<p>In thus ascribing to these great men complementary
parts in leading and shaping the
general movement, it is not meant that either
is deficient on the side attributed to the other.
Hawke showed by his actions that he was by
no means indifferent to tactical combinations,
which is another way of saying that he appreciated
the advantage of form in warfare; while
Rodney, though a careful organizer and driller
of fleets, and patient in effort to obtain advantage
before attacking, exhibited on occasion
headlong, though not inconsiderate, audacity,
and also tenacious endurance in fight. Still,
it will probably be admitted by the student of
naval biography that to him Hawke suggests
primarily the unhesitating sudden rush&mdash;the
swoop&mdash;upon the prey, while Rodney resembles
rather the patient astute watcher, carefully keeping
his own powers in hand, and waiting for
the unguarded moment when the adversary may
be taken suddenly at unawares. Certain it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
that, with opportunities much more numerous
than were permitted to Hawke, his successes
would have been far greater but for an excess
of methodical caution. There was a third, who
combined in due proportion, and possessed to
an extraordinary degree, the special qualities
here assigned to each. It is one of the ironies
of history that the first Sir Samuel Hood should
have had just opportunity enough to show how
great were his powers, and yet have been denied
the chance to exhibit them under conditions
to arrest the attention of the world; nay, have
been more than once compelled to stand by
hopelessly, and see occasions lost which he
would unquestionably have converted into signal
triumphs. In him, as far as the record goes,
was consummated the advance of the eighteenth
century. He was the greatest of the sowers.
It fell to Nelson, his pupil,&mdash;in part at least,&mdash;to
reap the harvest.</p>

<p>Before closing this part of our subject, the
necessary preliminary to understanding the
progress of naval warfare in the eighteenth century,
it is pertinent to note the respect in which
advance there differs from that of the nineteenth,
and in some degree, though less, from that
of the seventeenth centuries. The period was
not one of marked material development. Improvements
there were, but they were slow,
small in ultimate extent, and in no sense revolutionary.
Ships and guns, masts and sails, grew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
better, as did also administrative processes; it
may indeed be asserted, as an axiom of professional
experience, that as the military tone
of the sea-officers rises, the effect will be transmitted
to those civil functions upon which efficiency
for war antecedently depends. Still,
substantially, the weapons of war were in principle,
and consequently in general methods of
handling, the same at the end of the period
as at the beginning. They were intrinsically
more efficient; but the great gain was not in
them, but in the spirit and intellectual grasp
of the men who wielded them. There was no
change in the least analogous to that from
oars to sails, or from sails to steam.</p>

<p>Under such conditions of continued similarity in
means, advance in the practice of any profession is
effected rather in the realm of ideas, in intellectual
processes; and even their expert application involves
mind rather than matter. In the nineteenth
century such intellectual processes have been
largely devoted to the purposes of material development,
and have found their realization, in the navy
as elsewhere, in revolutionizing instruments, in
providing means never before attainable. The
railroad, the steamer, the electric telegraph, find
their counterpart in the heavily armored steamship
of war. But in utilizing these new means the
navy must still be governed by the ideas, which
are, indeed, in many ways as old as military
history, but which in the beginning of the eigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>teenth
century had passed out of the minds of
naval men. It was the task of the officers of
that period to recall them, to formulate them
anew, to give them a living hold upon the theory
and practice of the profession. This they did,
and they were undoubtedly helped in so doing
by the fact that their attention was not diverted
and absorbed, as that of our day very largely has
been, by decisive changes in the instruments with
which their ideas were to be given effect. Thus
they were able to make a substantial and distinctive
contribution to the art of naval warfare, and
that on its highest side. For the artist is greater
than his materials, the warrior than his arms;
and it was in the man rather than in his weapons
that the navy of the eighteenth century wrought
its final conspicuous triumph.</p>

<h2><a name="HAWKE" id="HAWKE"></a>HAWKE</h2>

<h4>1705-1781</h4>

<p>The first great name in British naval annals
belonging distinctively to the eighteenth
century rather than to the seventeenth, is that of
Edward Hawke. He was born in 1705, of a
family of no marked social distinction, his father
being a barrister, and his grandfather a London
merchant. His mother's maiden name was
Bladen. One of her brothers held an important
civil office as Commissioner of Trade and Plantations,
and was for many years a member of Parliament.
Under the conditions which prevailed
then, and for some generations longer, the influence
attaching to such positions enabled the
holder to advance substantially the professional
interests of a naval officer. Promotion in rank,
and occupation both in peace and war, were
largely a matter of favor. Martin Bladen naturally
helped his nephew in this way, a service
especially valuable in the earlier part of a career,
lifting a man out of a host of competitors and
giving him a chance to show what was in him.
It may readily be believed that Hawke's marked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
professional capacity speedily justified the advantage
thus obtained, and he seems to have owed
his promotion to post-captain to a superior
officer when serving abroad; though it is never
possible to affirm that even such apparent official
recognition was not due either to an intimation
from home, or to the give and take of those who
recognized Bismarck's motto, "Do ut des."</p>

<p>However this may have been, the service did
not suffer by the favors extended to Hawke.
Nor was his promotion unduly rapid, to the injury
of professional character, as often happened
when rank was prematurely reached. It was
not till March 20, 1734, that he was "made
post," as the expression went, by Sir Chaloner
Ogle into the frigate <i>Flamborough</i>, on the West
India Station. Being then twenty-nine years
old, in the prime of life for naval efficiency, he
had reached the position in which a fair opportunity
for all the honors of the profession lay
open to him, provided he could secure occupation
until he was proved to be indispensable. Here
also his uncle's influence stood good. Although
the party with which the experienced politician
was identified had gone out of power with Sir
Robert Walpole, in 1742, his position on the
Board dealing with Colonial affairs left him not
without friends. "My colleague, Mr. Cavendish,"
he writes, "has already laid in his claim for
another ship for you. But after so long a voyage"
(he had been away over three years) "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
think you should be allowed a little time to spend
with your friends on shore. It is some consolation,
however, that I have some friends on the
new Board of Admiralty." "There has been a
clean sweep," he says again, "but I hope I may have
some friends amongst the new Lords that will
upon my account afford you their protection."</p>

<p>This was in the beginning of 1743, when
Hawke had just returned from a protracted
cruise on the West India and North American
stations, where by far the greater part of his early
service was passed. He never again returned
there, and very shortly after his uncle's letter,
just quoted, he was appointed to the <i>Berwick</i>, a
ship-of-the-line of seventy guns. In command of
her he sailed in September, 1743, for the Mediterranean;
and a few months after, by his decided and
seamanlike course in Mathews's action, he established
his professional reputation and fortunes,
the firm foundations of which had been laid during
the previous years of arduous but inconspicuous
service. Two years later, in 1746, Martin
Bladen died, and with him political influence, in
the ordinary acceptation, departed from Hawke.
Thenceforth professional merit, forced upon men's
recognition, stood him in stead.</p>

<p>He was thirty-nine when he thus first made
his mark, in 1744. Prior to this there is
not found, in the very scanty records that
remain of his career, as in that of all officers of
his period while in subordinate positions, any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
certain proof that he had ever been seriously
engaged with an enemy. War against Spain
had been declared, October 19, 1739. He had
then recently commissioned a fifty-gun ship, the
<i>Portland</i>, and in her sailed for the West Indies,
where he remained until the autumn of 1742;
but the inert manner in which Spain maintained
the naval contest, notwithstanding that her transmarine
policy was the occasion of the quarrel,
and her West Indian possessions obviously endangered,
removed all chance of active service
on the large scale, except in attacking her colonies;
and in none of those enterprises had the
<i>Portland</i> been called upon to share.</p>

<p>Meantime, a general European war had begun
in 1740, concerning the succession to the Austrian
throne; and, in the political combinations
which followed, France and Great Britain had as
usual ranged themselves on opposite sides, though
without declaring war upon each other. Further,
there had existed for some time a secret defensive
alliance between France and Spain, binding
each party to support the other, under certain
conditions, with an effective armed force, to be
used not for aggressive purposes, but in defence
only. It was claimed, indeed, that by so doing
the supporting country was not to be considered
as going to war, or even as engaged in hostilities,
except as regarded the contingent furnished.
This view received some countenance from international
law, in the stage of development it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
had then reached; yet it is evident that if a British
admiral met a Spanish fleet, of strength fairly
matching his own, but found it accompanied by
a French division, the commander of which notified
him that he had orders to fight if an attack
were made, friendly relations between the two
nations would be strained near to the breaking
point. This had actually occurred to the British
Admiral Haddock, in the Mediterranean, in 1741;
and conditions essentially similar, but more exasperated,
constituted the situation under which
Hawke for the first time was brought into an
action between two great fleets.</p>

<p>On the 11th of January, 1744, when the <i>Berwick</i>
joined the British fleet, it had rendezvoused
at the Hy&egrave;res Islands, a little east of Toulon,
watching the movements of twelve Spanish ships-of-the-line,
which had taken refuge in the port.
As these were unwilling to put to sea trusting to
their own strength, the French Admiral De
Court was ordered to accompany and protect
them when they sailed. This becoming known,
Admiral Mathews had concentrated his fleet,
which by successive reinforcements&mdash;the <i>Berwick</i>
among others&mdash;numbered twenty-eight of-the-line
when the allies, in about equal force,
began to come out on the 20th of February.</p>

<p>The action which ensued owes its historical
significance wholly to the fact that it illustrated
conspicuously, and in more than one detail, the
degenerate condition of the official staff of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
British navy; the demoralization of ideals, and
the low average of professional competency.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
That there was plenty of good metal was also
shown, but the proportion of alloy was dangerously
great. That the machinery of the organization
was likewise bad, the administrative system
culpably negligent as well as inefficient, had been
painfully manifested in the equipment of the
ships, in the quality of the food, and in the
indifferent character of the ships' crews; but in
this respect Hawke had not less to complain of
than others, having represented forcibly to the
Admiralty the miserable unfitness of the men sent
him. Nevertheless, despite all drawbacks, including
therein a signalling system so rudimentary
and imperfect as to furnish a ready excuse to the
unwilling, as well as a recurrent perplexity to
those honestly wishing to obey their orders, he
showed that good will and high purpose could
not only lead a man to do his full duty as
directed, but guide him to independent initiative
action when opportunity offered. Under all
external conditions of difficulty and doubt, or even
of cast-iron rule, the principle was as true then as
when Nelson formulated it, that no captain when
in doubt could do very wrong if he placed his ship
alongside an enemy. That Hawke so realized it
brought out into more glaring relief the failure
of so many of his colleagues on this occasion.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>But the lesson would be in great part lost, if
there were to be seen in this lapse only the personal
element of the delinquents, and not the
widespread decline of professional tone. Undoubtedly,
of course, it is true that the personal
equation, as always, made itself felt, but here as
intensifying an evil which had its principal
source elsewhere.</p>

<p>Hawke carried Nelson's maxim into effect.
Upon the signal for battle he took his own ship
into close action with the antagonist allotted to
him by the order of the fleet; but after beating
her out of the line he looked round for more
work to do. Seeing then that several of the
British vessels had not come within point-blank,
but, through professional timidity, or over-cautious
reverence for the line of battle, were
engaging at long range a single Spaniard, he
quitted his own position, brought her also to close
quarters, and after an obstinate contest, creditable
to both parties, forced her to surrender. She was
the only ship to haul down her flag that day, and
her captain refused to surrender his sword to
any but Hawke, whom alone he accepted as his
vanquisher.</p>

<p>A generation or two later Hawke's conduct in
this matter would have drawn little attention; it
would not have been exceptional in the days of
St. Vincent and Nelson, nor even in that of
Howe. At the time of its occurrence, it was
not only in sharp contrast with much that hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>pened
on the same field of battle, but it was
somewhat contrary to rule. It possessed so far
the merit of originality; and that on the right
side,&mdash;the side of fighting. As in all active life,
so in war a man is more readily pardoned for
effecting too much than too little; and it was
doubly so here, because it was evident from the
behavior of his peers that he must expect no
backing in the extra work he took upon himself.
Their aloofness emphasized his forwardness; and
the fact that through the withdrawal of his
admiral for the night, the prize was ultimately
retaken, together with an officer and seamen he
had placed on board, fixed still further attention
upon the incident, in which Hawke's action was
the one wholly creditable feature.</p>

<p>The effect of the battle upon his fortunes was
summed up in a phrase. When his first lieutenant
was sent to report the loss of the prize-crew
to Rear-Admiral Rowley, the commander of the
division, the latter replied, among other things,
that "he had not been well acquainted with
Captain Hawke before, but he should now be
well acquainted with him from his behavior."
Like Nelson at St. Vincent, Hawke was now
revealed, not to the navy only but to the nation,&mdash;"through
his behavior." Somewhat exceptionally,
the king personally took knowledge of
him, and stood by him. George II. paid most
interested attention to the particulars elicited by
the Courts-Martial,&mdash;a fact which doubtless con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>tributed
to make him so sternly unyielding in
the case of Byng, twelve years later. To the king
Hawke became "my captain;" and his influence
was directly used when, in a flag promotion in
1747, some in the Admiralty proposed to include
Hawke in the retirement of senior captains, which
was a common incident in such cases. "I will
not have Hawke 'yellowed,'" was the royal fiat;
a yellow admiral being the current phrase for one
set aside from further active employment.</p>

<p>Such were the circumstances under which
Hawke first received experience of the fighting
conditions of the navy. Whatever his previous
attitude towards accepted traditions of professional
practice, this no doubt loosened the fetters;
for they certainly never constrained him
in his subsequent career. He remained in the
Mediterranean fleet, generally upon detached
services in command of divisions of ships, until
the end of 1745. Returning then to England,
he saw no further active service until he became
a Rear-Admiral&mdash;of the White&mdash;on July 15,
1747.</p>

<p>The promotions being numerous, Hawke's
seniority as captain carried him well up the list
of rear-admirals, and he was immediately employed;
hoisting his flag July 22d. He then
became second to Sir Peter Warren, commander-in-chief
of the "Western Squadron." This
cruised in the Bay of Biscay, from Ushant to
Finisterre, to intercept the naval divisions, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the accompanying convoys of merchant and
transport ships, with which the French were then
seeking to maintain their colonial empire in
North America and in India: an empire already
sorely shaken, and destined to fall finally in the
next great war.</p>

<p>Hawke was now in the road of good luck, pure
and unadulterated. His happy action in capturing
the <i>Poder</i> illustrates indeed opportunity improved;
but it was opportunity of the every day
sort, and it is the merit that seized it, rather than
the opportunity itself, that strikes the attention.
The present case was different. A young rear-admiral
had little reason to hope for independent
command; but Warren, a well-tried officer, possessing
the full confidence of the First Lord,
Anson, himself a master in the profession, was in
poor health, and for that reason had applied for
Hawke to be "joined with him in the command,"
apparently because he was the one flag-officer
immediately available. He proposed that Hawke
should for the present occasion take his place,
sail with a few ships named, and with them join
the squadron, then at sea in charge of a captain.
Anson demurred at first, on the ground of
Hawke's juniority,&mdash;he was forty-two,&mdash;and
Warren, while persisting in his request, shares
the doubt; for he writes, "I observe what you
say about the ships abroad being under so young
an officer. I am, and have been uneasy about it,
though I hope he will do well, <i>and it could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
then be avoided</i>." Anson, however, was not fixed
in his opposition; for Warren continued, "From
your letter I have so little reason to doubt his
being put under my command, that I have his
instructions all ready; and he is prepared to go
at a moment's notice." The instructions were
issued the following day, August 8th, and on the
9th Hawke sailed. But while there was in this
so much of luck, he was again to show that he
was not one to let occasion slip. Admiral Farragut
is reported to have said, "Every man has <i>one</i>
chance." It depends upon himself whether he is
by it made or marred. Burrish and Hawke toed
the same line on the morning of February 22d, and
they had had that day at least equal opportunity.</p>

<p>Hawke's adequacy to his present fortune betrayed
itself again in a phrase to Warren, "I
have nothing so much at heart as the faithful discharge
of my duty, and in such manner as will
give satisfaction both to the Lords of the Admiralty
and yourself. This shall ever be my utmost
ambition, and <i>no lucre of profit, or other views</i>,
shall induce me to act otherwise." Not prize-money;
but honor, through service. And this
in fact not only ruled his thought but in the
moment of decision inspired his act. Curiously
enough, however, he was here at odds with the
spirit of Anson and of Warren. The latter, in
asking Hawke's employment, said the present
cruise was less important than the one to succeed
it, "for the galleons"&mdash;the Spanish treasure-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ships&mdash;"make
it a general rule to come home
late in the fall or winter." Warren by prize-money
and an American marriage was the richest
commoner in England, and Anson it was that
had captured the great galleon five years before,
to his own great increase; but it was Hawke who,
acknowledging a letter from Warren, as this
cruise was drawing to its triumphant close, wrote,
"With respect to the galleons, as it is uncertain
when they will come home and <i>likewise impossible
for me to divide my force in the</i> present
necessitous condition of the ships under my
command, I must lay aside all thoughts of them
during this cruise." In this unhesitating subordination
of pecuniary to military considerations
we see again the temper of Nelson, between whom
and Hawke there was much community of spirit,
especially in their independence of ordinary motives
and standards. "Not that I despise money,"
wrote Nelson near the end of a career in which
he had never known ease of circumstances;
"quite the contrary, I wish I had a hundred
thousand pounds this moment;" but "I keep the
frigates about me, for I know their value in the
day of battle, and compared with that day, what
signifies any prizes they might take?" Yet he
had his legal share in every such prize.</p>

<p>The opening of October 14th, the eighth day
after Hawke's letter to Warren just quoted,
brought him the sight of his reward. At seven
that morning, the fleet being then some four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
hundred miles west of La Rochelle in France, a
number of sails were seen in the southeast. Chase
was given at once, and within an hour it was evident,
from the great crowd of vessels, that it was a
large convoy outward-bound which could only be
enemies. It was in fact a fleet of three hundred
French merchantmen, under the protection of
eight ships-of-the-line and one of fifty guns,
commanded by Commodore L'Etendu&egrave;re. The
force then with Hawke were twelve of-the-line
and two of fifty guns. Frigates and lighter
vessels of course accompanied both fleets. The
average size and armament of the French vessels
were considerably greater than those of the British;
so that, although the latter had an undoubted
superiority, it was far from as great as
the relative numbers would indicate. Prominent
British officers of that day claimed that a French
sixty-gun ship was practically the equal of a
British seventy-four. In this there may have
been exaggeration; but they had good opportunity
for judging, as many French ships were
captured.</p>

<p>When L'Etendu&egrave;re saw that he was in the
presence of a superior enemy, he very manfully
drew out his ships of war from the mass, and
formed them in order of battle, covering the convoy,
which he directed to make its escape accompanied
by one of the smaller ships-of-the-line
with the light cruisers. He contrived also to
keep to windward of the approaching British.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
With so strong a force interposed, Hawke saw
that no prize-money was easily to be had, but
for that fortune his mind was already prepared.
He first ordered his fleet to form order of battle;
but finding time was thereby lost he changed the
signal to that for a general chase, which freed the
faster sailers to use their utmost speed and join
action with the enemy, secure of support in due
time by their consorts as they successively came
up.</p>

<p>Half an hour before noon the leading British
reached the French rear, already under short
canvas. The admiral then made signal to engage,
and the battle began. As the ships under
fire reduced sail, the others overtook them, passed
by the unengaged side and successively attacked
from rear to van. As Hawke himself drew near,
Rodney's ship, the <i>Eagle</i>, having her wheel and
much of her rigging shot away, was for the time
unmanageable and fell twice on board the flag-ship,
the <i>Devonshire</i>, driving her to leeward, and
so preventing her from close action with the
French flag-ship <i>Tonnant</i>, of eighty guns, a force
far exceeding that of the <i>Devonshire</i>, which had
but sixty-six. "This prevented our attacking <i>Le
Monarque</i>, 74, and the <i>Tonnant</i>, within any distance
to do execution. However we attempted
both, especially the latter. While we were engaged
with her, the breechings of all our lower-deck
guns broke, and the guns flew fore and aft,
which obliged us to shoot ahead, for our upper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
guns could not reach her." The breaking of
the breechings&mdash;the heavy ropes which take the
strain of the guns' recoil&mdash;was doubtless accelerated
by the undue elevation necessitated by
the extreme range. The collision with the <i>Eagle</i>
was one of the incidents common to battle, but
it doubtless marred the completeness of the victory.
Of the eight French ships engaged, six were
taken; two, the <i>Tonnant</i> and her next astern,
escaped, though the former was badly mauled.</p>

<p>Despite the hindrance mentioned, Hawke's
personal share in the affair was considerable,
through the conspicuous activity of the flag-ship.
Besides the skirmish at random shot with the
<i>Tonnant</i>, she engaged successively the <i>Trident</i>,
64, and the <i>Terrible</i>, 74, both which were among
the prizes. He was entirely satisfied also with
the conduct of all his captains,&mdash;save one. The
freedom of action permitted to them by the general
chase, with the inspiring example of the
admiral himself, was nobly used. "Captain Harland
of the <i>Tilbury</i>, 60, observing that the <i>Tonnant</i>
fired single guns at us in order to dismast
us, stood on the other tack, <i>between her and the
Devonshire</i>, and gave her a very smart fire." It
was no small gallantry for a 60 thus to pass close
under the undiverted broadside of an 80,&mdash;nearly
double her force,&mdash;and that without orders; and
Hawke recognized the fact by this particular
notice in the despatch. With similar initiative, as
the <i>Tonnant</i> and <i>Intr&eacute;pide</i> were seen to be escap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>ing,
Captain Saunders of the Yarmouth, 64, pursued
them on his own motion, and was accompanied,
at his suggestion, by the sixty-gun ships of Rodney
and of Saumarez. A detached action of an
hour followed, in which Saumarez fell. The
enemy escaped, it is true; but that does not impeach
the judgment, nor lessen the merits, of the
officers concerned, for their ships were both
much smaller and more injured than those they
attacked. Harland and Saunders became distinguished
admirals; of Rodney it is needless
to say the same.</p>

<p>In his report of the business, Hawke used a
quaint but very expressive phrase, "As the
enemy's ships were large, <i>they took a great deal
of drubbing</i>, and (consequently) lost all their
masts, except two, who had their foremasts left.
This has obliged me to lay-to for these two days
past, in order to put them into condition to be
brought into port, as well as our own, which have
suffered greatly." Ships large in tonnage were
necessarily also ships large in scantling, heavy
ribbed, thick-planked, in order to bear their artillery;
hence also with sides not easy to be pierced
by the weak ordnance of that time. They were
in a degree armored ships, though from a cause
differing from that of to-day; hence much "drubbing"
was needed, and the prolongation of the
drubbing entailed increase of incidental injury
to spars and rigging, both their own and those
of the enemy. Nor was the armor idea, directly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
at all unrecognized even then; for we are told
of the <i>Real Felipe</i> in Mathews's action, that, being
so weakly built that she could carry only twenty-four-pounders
on her lower deck, she had been
"fortified in the most extraordinary surprising
manner; her sides being lined four or five foot
thick everywhere with junk or old cables to
hinder the shot from piercing."</p>

<p>It has been said that the conduct of one captain
fell under Hawke's displeasure. At a Council
of War called by him after the battle, to
establish the fitness of the fleet to pursue the
convoy, the other captains objected to sitting
with Captain Fox of the <i>Kent</i>, until he had
cleared himself from the imputation of misbehavior
in incidents they had noticed. Hawke
was himself dissatisfied with Fox's failure to
obey a signal, and concurred in the objection.
On the subsequent trial, the Court expressly
cleared the accused of cowardice, but found him
guilty of certain errors of judgment, and specifically
of leaving the <i>Tonnant</i> while the signal for close
action was flying. As the <i>Tonnant</i> escaped, the
implication of accountability for that result naturally
follows. For so serious a consequence the
sentence only was that he be dismissed his ship,
and, although never again employed, he was retired
two years after as a rear-admiral. It was
becoming increasingly evident that error of judgment
is an elastic phrase which can be made to
cover all degrees of faulty action, from the mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>takes
to which every man is liable and the most
faithful cannot always escape, to conduct wholly
incompatible with professional efficiency or even
manly honor.</p>

<p>The case of Fox was one of many occurring at
about this period, which, however differing in
detail between themselves, showed that throughout
the navy, both in active service before the
enemy, and in the more deliberate criteria of
opinion which influence Courts-Martial, there
was a pronounced tendency to lowness of standard
in measuring officer-like conduct and official
responsibility for personal action; a misplaced
leniency, which regarded failure to do the utmost
with indulgence, if without approval. In the stringent
and awful emergencies of war too much is at
stake for such easy tolerance. Error of judgment
is one thing; error of conduct is something very
different, and with a difference usually recognizable.
To style errors of conduct "errors of judgment"
denies, practically, that there are standards
of action external to the individual, and condones
official misbehavior on the ground of personal
incompetency. Military standards rest on demonstrable
facts of experience, and should find
their sanction in clear professional opinion. So
known, and so upheld, the unfortunate man who
falls below them, in a rank where failure may
work serious harm, has only himself to blame;
for it is his business to reckon his own capacity
before he accepts the dignity and honors of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
position in which the interests of the nation are
intrusted to his charge.</p>

<p>An uneasy consciousness of these truths, forced
upon the Navy and the Government by widespread
shortcomings in many quarters&mdash;of
which Mathews's battle was only the most conspicuous
instance&mdash;resulted in a very serious
modification of the Articles of War, after the
peace. Up to 1748 the articles dealing with
misconduct before the enemy, which had been in
force since the first half of the reign of Charles
II., assigned upon conviction the punishment of
"death, or other punishment, as the circumstances
of the offence shall deserve and the
Court-Martial shall judge fit." After the experiences
of this war, the last clause was omitted.
Discretion was taken away. Men were dissatisfied,
whether justly or not, with the use of their
discretion made by Courts-Martial, and deprived
them of it. In the United States Navy, similarly,
at the beginning of the Civil War, the Government
was in constant struggle with Courts-Martial
to impose sentences of severity adequate
to the offence; leaving the question of remission,
or of indulgence, to the executive. These facts
are worthy of notice, for there is a facile popular
impression that Courts-Martial err on the side of
stringency. The writer, from a large experience
of naval Courts, upon offenders of many ranks,
is able to affirm that it is not so. Marryat, in
his day, midway between the two periods here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
specified, makes the same statement, in "Peter
Simple." "There is an evident inclination towards
the prisoner; every allowance and every
favor granted him, and no legal quibbles attended
to." It may be added that the inconvenience and
expense of assembling Courts make the executive
chary of this resort, which is rarely used except
when the case against an accused is pretty clear,&mdash;a
fact that easily gives rise to a not uncommon
assertion, that Courts-Martial are organized to
convict.</p>

<p>This is the antecedent history of Byng's trial
and execution. There had been many examples
of weak and inefficient action&mdash;of distinct errors
of conduct&mdash;such as Byng was destined to illustrate
in the highest rank and upon a large scale,
entailing an unusual and conspicuous national
disaster; and the offenders had escaped, with
consequences to themselves more or less serious,
but without any assurance to the nation that the
punishment inflicted was raising professional
standards, and so giving reasonable certainty that
the like derelictions would not recur. Hence
it came to pass, in 1749, not amid the agitations
of war and defeats, but in profound peace,
that the article was framed under which Byng
suffered:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Every person in the fleet, who through cowardice,
negligence, or disaffection, shall in time of action, ... not
do his utmost to take or destroy every ship which it
shall be his duty to engage; and to assist all and every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of His Majesty's ships, or those of His allies, which it
shall be his duty to assist and relieve, ... being convicted
thereof by sentence of a Court-Martial, shall suffer
death."</p></div>

<p>Let it therefore be observed, as historically
certain, that the execution of Byng in 1757 is
directly traceable to the war of 1739-1747. It
was not determined, as is perhaps generally
imagined, by an obsolete statute revived for the
purpose of a judicial murder; but by a recent Act,
occasioned, if not justified, by circumstances of
marked national humiliation and injury. The
offences specified are those of which repeated
instances had been recently given; and negligence
is ranked with more positive faults, because
in practice equally harmful and equally culpable.
Every man in active life, whatever his business,
knows this to be so.</p>

<p>At the time his battle with L'Etendu&egrave;re was
fought, Hawke was actually a commander-in-chief;
for Warren, through his disorder increasing upon
him, had resigned the command, and Hawke had
been notified of the fact. Hence there did not
obtain in his case the consideration, so absurdly
advanced for limiting Nelson's reward after the
Nile, that he was acting under the orders of a
superior several hundred miles away. Nevertheless,
Hawke, like Nelson later, was then a new
man,&mdash;"a young officer;" and the honor he
received, though certainly adequate for a victory
over a force somewhat inferior, was not adequate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
when measured by that given to Anson, the First
Lord of the Admiralty, for a much less notable
achievement six months before. Anson
was raised to the peerage; Hawke was only
given the Order of the Bath, the ribbon which
Nelson coveted, because a public token, visible
to all, that the wearer had done distinguished
service. It was at that period a much greater distinction
than it afterwards became, through the
great extension in numbers and the division into
classes. He was henceforth Sir Edward Hawke;
and shortly after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
signed April 30, 1748, another flag-promotion
raised him to the rank of Vice-Admiral, of the
Blue Squadron.</p>

<p>Such rank, accompanied by such recognized
merit, insured that he should thenceforth always
command in chief; and so it was, with a single
brief interval due to a very special and exceptional
cause to be hereafter related. During the years
of peace, from 1748 to 1755, his employment was
mainly on shore, in dockyard command, which
carried with it incidentally a good deal of presiding
over Courts-Martial. This duty, in his
hands, could hardly fail to raise professional
standards, with all the effect that precedents,
established by the rulings and decisions of Courts,
civil and military, exert upon practice. Such a
period, however, affords but little for narration,
either professional or personal, except when the
particular occupations mentioned are the subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of special study. General interest they cannot
be said to possess.</p>

<p>But while thus unmarked on the biographical
side, historically these years were pregnant with
momentous events, which not only affected the
future of great nations then existing, but were
to determine for all time the extension or restriction
of their social systems and political tendencies
in vast distant regions yet unoccupied
by civilized man, or still in unstable political
tenure. The balance of world power, in short,
was in question, and that not merely as every
occurrence, large or small, contributes its something
to a general result, but on a grand and
decisive scale. The phrase "world politics," if
not yet invented, characterizes the issues then
eminently at stake, though they probably were
not recognized by contemporaries, still blinded
by the traditions which saw in Europe alone the
centre of political interests.</p>

<p>To realize the conditions, and their bearing
upon a future which has become our present, we
should recall that in 1748 the British Empire, as
we understand the term, did not exist; that
Canada and Louisiana&mdash;meaning by the latter
the whole undefined region west of the Mississippi&mdash;were
politically and socially French;
that between them the wide territory from the
Alleghanies to the Mississippi was claimed by
France, and the claim vigorously contested not
only by Great Britain herself, but by the thirteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
British colonies which became the United States
of America; that in India the representatives of
both mother countries were striving for mastery,
not merely through influence in the councils of
native rulers, but by actual territorial sway, and that
the chances seemed on the whole to favor France.</p>

<p>In the great struggle for Anglo-Saxon predominance,
which had begun under William III.,
but was now approaching its crisis and final decision
in the Seven Years War, the determining
factor was to be the maritime strength of Great
Britain. It is, therefore, the distinctive and distinguished
significance of Hawke's career that
during so critical a period he not only was the
most illustrious and able officer of her navy&mdash;the
exponent of her sea-power&mdash;but that by
the force of his personality he chiefly shaped the
naval outcome. He carried on the development
of naval warfare, revolutionized ideas, raised professional
standards, and thereby both affected
the result in his own time, and perpetuated an
influence, the effect of which was to be felt in the
gigantic contests of later days. In this eminent
particular, which involves real originality, no sea
officer of the eighteenth century stands with him;
in this respect only he and Nelson, who belongs
rather to the nineteenth, are to be named
together.</p>

<p>In the years of nominal peace, 1748-1755, the
Navy of Great Britain was permitted by a politically
cautious Government to decline much in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
power; but there was compensation in the fact
that that of France drooped equally. In both
countries there was then, as there has been ever
since, a party opposed to over-sea enterprise.
"The partisans of the Ministry," wrote Walpole
in 1755, "d&mdash;n the Plantations [Colonies], and
ask if we are to involve ourselves in a war for
them." The French government underwent a
like revulsion of feeling as regarded India, and in
1754 recalled Dupleix in mid-career, in order to
quiet the remonstrances of Great Britain. It
would be irrelevant, were it not signally instructive,
to remark that both nations passed under
the influence of the same ideas a hundred years
later. In the middle of the nineteenth century,
the preponderant expression in England was that
the colonies were unprofitable incumbrances, and,
if occasion arose, should be encouraged to separate
rather than urged to remain; while France,
through whatever motive, at a critical moment
abandoned the field in Egypt, by refusing joint
action. It is, therefore, probably the result of
a true national genius, asserting itself above
temporary aberrations, that the close of the
nineteenth century saw France wholly excluded,
politically, from Egypt, as she had before been
from India, and Great Britain involved in an
expensive war, the aim of which was the preservation
of the imperial system, in the interest
not only of the mother country, but of the colonies
as well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>And that it was in the interest of her colonies
was precisely the all important part which differentiated
the Seven Years War in its day, and the
South African War in our day, from the struggle,
so disastrous to the Empire, that is known as the
American Revolution. "There is no repose for
our thirteen colonies," wrote Franklin a hundred
and fifty years ago, "so long as the French are
masters of Canada." "There is no repose for
British colonists in South Africa," was the virtual
assertion of Natal and the Cape Colony, "so long
as the Boer political methods are maintained in
the Transvaal with the pledged support of the
Orange Free State." Irreconcilable differences
of political and social systems, when brought into
close contact, involve irrepressible conflict, and
admit of no lasting solution except the subjugation
and consequent submersion of one or the
other.</p>

<p>Such a final settlement was attained in North
America and in India by the Seven Years War.
The full results thereof even we of this day have
not yet seen; for who can yet predict the effect
upon the question of the Pacific and of China,
that by this war was assured the dominance of
the Anglo-Saxon political and legal tradition over
the whole American continent north of the
tropics, and that the same tradition shall, for a
future yet indeterminate, decisively shape the
course of India and the Philippines? The preceding
war, 1739-1748, had been substantially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
inconclusive on the chief points at issue, because
European questions intervening had diverted the
attention of both France and Great Britain from
America and from India; and the exhaustion
of both had led to a perfunctory compact, in
which the underlying contention was substantially
ignored in order to reach formal agreement.
That the French conquest of Madras, in India,
was yielded in exchange for Louisburg and Cape
Breton Island, which the American colonists had
won for England, typifies concisely the <i>status quo</i>
to which both parties were willing momentarily
to revert, while they took breath before the inevitable
renewal of the strife, with added fury, a few
years later; but then upon its proper scene, the
sea and the over-sea regions in dispute.</p>

<p>In this great arbitrament Hawke was at once
called forth to play his part. In 1754 diplomatic
contention had become acrimonious, and various
events showed that the moment of open conflict
was approaching. The squadron in India was
then considerably increased. In the beginning
of 1755 Hawke was again afloat to command the
Channel Fleet, the operations of which extended
ordinarily from the Channel, over the Bay of
Biscay, to Cape Finisterre. A naval force was
collecting at the same time at Portsmouth, under
Boscawen, to counteract the preparations the
French were known to be making in North
America. It sailed soon afterwards, with orders
to intercept a squadron convoying reinforcements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
for Canada; and on the 8th of June two of these
ships were captured off the mouth of the St.
Lawrence, the remainder escaping under cover of
a fog. In July Hawke went out, with instructions
to take any French ships-of-the-line that he might
meet; and in August he was further directed to
send into port French ships of every kind, merchant
and other, that he might encounter. Before
the end of the year three hundred trading vessels,
valued at $6,000,000, had been thus seized. War
had not yet been declared, but the captured
vessels were held, as on other occasions before
and after, as hostages to await the settlement of
existing difficulties.</p>

<p>The French government protested of course,
and recalled its ambassador, but it did not proceed
to formal hostilities. A great stroke was in
preparation at Toulon, which could be covered
for a while by diplomatic correspondence, coupled
with angry demonstrations on the Atlantic and
Channel coasts. On the 10th of April, 1756,
twelve French ships-of-the-line and fifteen thousand
troops sailed for Minorca, then a British
possession, and in the absence of a hostile fleet
effected a landing without opposition. The British
cabinet having taken alarm too late, Admiral
Byng had sailed from Portsmouth, with ten ships,
only three days before the French left Toulon;
when he arrived off Port Mahon, six weeks later,
a practicable breach in the works had already
been made. The French fleet was cruising out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>side
in support of the siege, and Byng, whose
force had been increased to thirteen ships, engaged
it on May 20. The action was in itself indecisive;
but, upon the opinion of a council of war
that nothing more could be done, Byng retired to
Gibraltar. The result to him personally is well
known. Port Mahon surrendered on June 28.
War had by this been declared; by Great Britain
on the 17th of May, and by France June 20, 1756.</p>

<p>When the news of Byng's retreat was received
in England, Hawke was sent out to supersede
him. He went only personally, accompanied by
a second in command, but with no fleet, and with
sealed instructions. Opening these when he
reached Gibraltar, he found orders to send home
Byng and his second in command, and to institute
an inquiry into the conduct of the captains, suspending
any one found "not to have acted with
due spirit and vigor." An investigation of this
kind would enable him to form an opinion of
Byng's own conduct even more exact and authentic
than his other official opportunities for personal
intercourse with the chief actors, but he must
have refrained with much discretion from expressing
his judgment on the affair in such way as to
reach the public ear. It was stated in the "Gentleman's
Magazine," in 1766, that an inquiry was
provoked in the House of Commons, shortly after
these events, by Pitt, who took Byng's side; but
that Hawke, being a member of the House, denied
some of Pitt's allegations as to the inadequacy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Byng's fleet, on the strength of his own personal
observation after taking over the command.
Thereupon, so the account says, the categorical
test question, the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>, was
put to him whether with Byng's means he could
have beat the enemy; and the manner of the first
Pitt, in thus dealing with an opponent in debate,
can be imagined from what we know of him otherwise.
Whether the story be true or not, Hawke
was not a man to be so overborne, and the reply
related is eminently characteristic, "By the grace
of God, he would have given a good account of
them." Whatever the reason, there seems little
doubt that Pitt did not like Hawke; but the latter
was at once too independent to care, and too
necessary to be discarded.</p>

<p>He remained in the Mediterranean only six
months, returning to England in January, 1757.
His tenure of this command was marked by an
incident which exemplifies the vigorous exercise
of power frequent in naval commanders, in the
days when neither steam nor telegraph existed to
facilitate reference home for instructions; when
men with their strong right arms redressed on
the spot what they thought a wrong. A British
ship carrying supplies to Gibraltar, where Hawke
was then lying, was captured by a French privateer
and taken into the Spanish port of Algeciras, on
the opposite side of the bay. Her surrender was
demanded from the governor of the port, Spain
being then neutral; but, being refused, the admiral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
sent the boats of the squadron and cut her out.
This being resisted by the Spanish forts, a hundred
British seamen were killed or wounded. On
the admiral's return home, Pitt is reported to
have told him that he thought he would himself
have acted in the same way, but would have made
some concession afterwards. Hawke replied that
his duty, having the country's force in his hands,
was to act as he had,&mdash;not to make concessions;
but that the Ministry could deal with the case
subsequently as it thought fit. In other words, as
in joint operations with the army, later in the year,
he took the ground that the land officers were the
judges of their own business, but that he would
see them put safe on shore, as a first step; so
in a matter affecting national honor, as he conceived
it, he would do the seaman's part and
redress the injury, after which the civil authority
could arrange with the other party. The known
details of this transaction are not full enough to
permit a decided opinion as to how far the admiral
was justified in his action, judged even by the international
law of the day. It was not necessarily
a breach of neutrality to admit a belligerent with
her prize; but it would have been, had the French
ship gone out from Algeciras, seized her prey,
and returned with it. Whatever the facts, however,
the episode illustrates interestingly the spirit
of Hawke himself, and of the service of that day,
as well as his characteristic independence towards
superiors when he felt himself right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>From this time forward Hawke's service was
confined to the Channel Fleet. This was, during
that war, the post for the most capable of British
officers; for, while the matter at stake was over-sea
predominance and conquest, yet both these
depended upon the communications of the French
colonies and distant possessions with the mother
country. The source of all their strength, the
one base indispensable to their operations, was
the coast of France; to close exit from this was
therefore to strike at the root. This was much
less true for the colonies of Great Britain, at
least in America; their numbers, and resources
in every way, were so far superior to those of
Canada that they needed only to be preserved
from interference by the navy of France,&mdash;an
end also furthered by the close watch of the
French ports. This blockade, as it is often, but
erroneously, styled, Hawke was the first to maintain
thoroughly and into the winter months;
and in so doing he gave an extension to the
practice of naval warfare, which amounted to a
veritable revolution in naval strategy. The conception
was one possible only to a thorough seaman,
who knew exactly and practically what ships
could do; one also in whom professional knowledge
received the moral support of strong natural
self-confidence,&mdash;power to initiate changes, to
assume novel responsibility, through the inner
assurance of full adequacy to bear it.</p>

<p>All this Hawke had. The method, therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the holding the sea, and the exposure of heavy
ships to weather before thought impossible, was
well within the range of his ability,&mdash;of his
native and acquired faculties; but it is due to him
to recognize the intellectual force, the originality,
which lifted him above the accepted tradition of
his predecessors, and by example transmitted to
the future a system of warfare that then, as well
as in his own hands, was to exercise a decisive
effect upon the course of history. It is also to
be remembered that he took this weighty step
with instruments relatively imperfect, and greatly
so. The bottoms of ships were not yet coppered;
in consequence they fouled very rapidly, the
result of which was loss of speed. This meant
that much greater power, press of canvas, was
needed to force them through the water, and that
they had to be sent frequently into port to be
cleaned. Thus they were less able than ships of
later days to overtake an enemy, or to keep off
a lee shore, while more intricate administration
and more ships were required to maintain the
efficiency of the squadron by a system of reliefs.
Hawke noted also another difficulty,&mdash;the fatigue
of the crews in cleaning their ships' bottoms. It
was even more important to success, he said, to
restore the seaman, worn by cruising, by a few
days quiet and sleep in port, than to clean thoroughly
at the expense of exhausting them. "If
the enemy should slip out and run," he writes,
"we must follow as fast as we can." Details<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
such as these, as well as the main idea, must be
borne in mind, if due credit is to be given to
Hawke for one of the most decisive advances
ever made in the practice of naval campaigning.</p>

<p>Some time, however, was to elapse before the
close watch of the French ports became a leading
feature in the naval policy of the government.
The early disasters of the war had forced the
king, after much resistance, finally to accept the
first Pitt as the leading minister of the Crown,
in June, 1757. Pitt's military purpose embraced
two principal objects: 1, the establishment of the
British colonial system by the destruction of that
of France, which involved as a necessary precedent
the control of the sea by a preponderant
navy; and, 2, the support of Frederic of Prussia,
then engaged in his deadly contest with the
combined armies of France, Austria, and Russia.
Frederic's activity made a heavy drain upon the
troops and the treasure of France, preventing her
by just so much from supporting her colonies
and maintaining her fleet; but, heavily outnumbered
as he was, it was desirable to work all
possible diversion in his favor by attacks elsewhere.
This Pitt proposed to do by a series of
descents upon the French coast, compelling the
enemy to detach a large force from before the
Prussian king to protect their own shores.</p>

<p>As far as the home naval force was concerned,
the years 1757 and 1758 were dominated by this
idea of diversion in favor of Frederic the Great.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
From the general object of these enterprises, the
army was necessarily the principal agent; but the
navy was the indispensable auxiliary. Hawke's
association with them is interesting chiefly as
illustrative of professional character; for there
was little or no room for achievement of naval
results. The first expedition in which he was
concerned was that against Rochefort in 1757.
This, though now long forgotten, occasioned by
its failure a storm of contemporary controversy.
Whatever chances of success it may under any
circumstances have had were lost beforehand,
owing to the lateness of the season&mdash;June&mdash;in
which Pitt took office. Preparation began at the
moment when execution was due. The troops
which should have sailed in early summer could
not, from delays apparently unavoidable under
the conditions, get away before September 10.
Hawke himself hoisted his flag&mdash;assumed active
command&mdash;only on August 15. The previous
administration was responsible for whatever defect
in general readiness increased this delay; as
regards the particular purpose, Pitt's government
was at fault in attempting at all an undertaking
which, begun so late in the year, could not expect
success under the notorious inadequacy of organization
bequeathed to him by his predecessors.
But there will always be found at the beginning
of a war, or upon a change of commanders, a
restless impatience to do something, to make a
showing of results, which misleads the judgment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of those in authority, and commonly ends, if not
in failure, at least in barren waste of powder
and shot.</p>

<p>Not the least of the drawbacks under which the
enterprise labored was extremely defective information&mdash;especially
hydrographic. The character
of the coast, the places suited for landing,
the depths of water, and the channels, were practically
unknown. Hence a necessity for reconnoissances,
pregnant of indefinite delay, as might
have been foreseen. Among Hawke's memoranda
occur the words, "Not to undertake anything
without good pilots." The phrase is doubly
significant, for he was not a man to worry needlessly
about pilots, knowing that pilots look not
to military results, but merely to their own
responsibility not to take the ground; and it
shows the total ignorance under which labored
all who were charged with an undertaking that
could only succeed as a surprise, executed with
unhesitating rapidity. Hawke himself was
astounded at finding in Basque Roads, before
Rochefort, "a safe spacious road in which all the
navy of England, merchant ships included, may
ride without the least annoyance. Before I came
here, the place was represented as very difficult
of access, and so narrow that ships could not lie
in safety from the forts&mdash;nay, <i>the pilots made
many baulks before we came in</i>." In fact, want
of good pilotage summed up the fault of the expedition,
from its inception in the Cabinet through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>out
all the antecedent steps of consultation and
preparation. Pitt's impetuosity doubtless acted
as a spur to laggards, but it was accompanied by
a tendency to overbearing insolence that not infrequently
browbeats cautious wisdom. When
applied to a man like Hawke, strong in natural
temper and in conscious mastery of his profession,
the tone characteristic of Pitt provokes an equally
resolute self-assertion, as far removed from subjection
as it is from insubordination; but friendship
becomes impossible, and even co-operation
difficult.</p>

<p>Throughout all Hawke kept his head, and made
no serious mistake; but he accepts no unmerited
censures. Seeing that the transports are not
enough for the healthful carriage of the troops,
he so represents it. The government, already
impatient at any report of defects, hopes that
things are now arranged to his <i>satisfaction</i>. "I
am astonished at this expression," he says, "it is
my duty to represent defects, but I am <i>satisfied</i>
with any decision <i>you</i> make." Again, "I have
received your letter signifying His Majesty's directions
to use the utmost diligence in embarking
the troops and getting to sea. As I cannot doubt
my letter of Sunday being immediately communicated
to you, I should have expected that <i>before
yours was sent</i> His Majesty would have been fully
satisfied that I needed no spur in executing his
orders." As Hawke and Anson&mdash;the First Lord&mdash;were
friends, there can be little doubt that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
see here a firm protest against the much lauded
tone to which the efficiency of the British army
and navy under Pitt has been too exclusively
attributed. It was in the civil administration, the
preparation that underlies military success, which
being at home was under his own eye, that Pitt's
energy was beneficially felt, and also in his prompt
recognition of fit instruments; but he had no
need to discover Hawke or Boscawen. He might
as well be thought to have discovered the sun.</p>

<p>In discharging his part of the expedition Hawke's
course is consistent and clear. It must in the
first place be recognized that such enterprises are
of secondary importance, and do not warrant the
risks which are not only justifiable but imperative
when a decisive issue is at stake. Hawke's heroic
disregard of pilotage difficulties at Quiberon, in
1759, would have been culpable temerity at Basque
Roads, in 1757. But, save delays on this account,
no time is lost by him. When the decision to
land is reached, he is clear as to the possibility of
landing; but when the generals think it impossible
to effect certain results, he replies that is
their business, on which he does not pretend to
judge. In his evidence before the Court afterwards,
he said, "Whether they should land or
not, he constantly thought it the part of the
generals to determine. He could not but suppose
they were infinitely better judges of their own
business than he could be." Their conduct was
marked by vacillations strange to him, and which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
apparently displeased him; the troops being, on
one occasion, embarked in the boats for some
hours, and yet returning to the ships without proceeding.
He then addressed a formal letter to
the commanding general, saying that if he had no
further operation to propose the fleet would return
at once to England, and he declined to attend a
Council of War to decide either of these points.
The Army should decide, alone, whether it could
effect anything by landing; if not, he, without
asking counsel, would stay no longer. On October
7th he reached Spithead.</p>

<p>Pitt, who had espoused Byng's cause against
the previous administration, followed its precedent
in throwing the blame on the military and naval
leaders. In Parliament, he "declared solemnly
his belief that there was a determined resolution,
both in the naval and military commanders, against
any vigorous exertion of the national power."
For far less than this accusation Byng had been
condemned; but in fact the fault at Rochefort lay
clearly on those who issued the orders,&mdash;upon
the Cabinet; upon the character of the expedition
itself,&mdash;a great risk for a secondary and doubtful
object; upon the inconsiderate haste which disregarded
alike the season and the inadequate knowledge;
upon defective preparation in the broadest
sense of the words. Diversions, in truth, are
feints, in which the utmost smoke with the least
fire is the object. Carried farther, they entail
disaster; for they rest on no solid basis of adequate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
force, but upon successful deception. Pitt's angry
injustice met with its due rebuke the next year at
St. Cas. It can scarcely be doubted that words
such as those quoted were responsible, in part at
least, for the disastrous issue of that diversion, the
story of which belongs, if to the navy at all, to the
life of Howe.</p>

<p>That Hawke resented this language can
scarcely be doubted, and none the less that he
evidently himself felt that something might have
been attempted by the troops. He was clear of
fault in his own consciousness; but in the general
censure he was involved with his associates&mdash;known,
so to say, by his friends, implicated in the
meshes of a half-truth, where effort to clear one's
self results in worse entanglement. He had the
manly cast of character which will not struggle
for self-vindication; but his suppressed wrath
gathered force, until a year later it resulted, upon
occasion of official provocation, in an explosion
that has not a close parallel in naval history.</p>

<p>He had hoisted his flag again on February
28, 1758. His first service was directed against
a French squadron of five ships-of-the-line, fitting
at Rochefort to convoy troops for the relief of
Louisburg, in Cape Breton Island, then about
to be besieged by British and colonial forces.
Hawke's observations of the previous year had
ascertained the hitherto unknown facilities of
Basque Roads for occupation by a fleet and consequent
effectual interception of such an expedi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>tion.
Upon making the land the French vessels
were found already in the Roads, therefore soon
to sail; but before this superior force of seven
ships they cut their cables, and fled across the
shoals up the river Charente, on which Rochefort
lies. Hawke, instructed by his previous experience,
had earnestly but fruitlessly demanded fire-ships
and bomb-vessels to destroy the enemy in
case they grounded on the flats; which they did,
and for some hours lay exposed to such an attack.
Not having these means, he had to watch helplessly
the process of lightening and towing by
which they at last made their escape. He then
returned to England, having frustrated the relief
expedition but, through defective equipment, not
destroyed the vessels. The Admiralty, upon receiving
his report of the transaction, made no
acknowledgments to him.</p>

<p>Pitt had profited by Hawke's ineffectual request
for small vessels and his suffering from the
want of them; but he utilized the suggestions in a
manner that robbed their author of any share in
the results. A squadron of that sort was to be
constituted, to operate on the French coast in
diversions like that of 1757; but it was to be an
independent command, under an officer chosen
by the Government without consulting the admiral.
To the main fleet was assigned the necessary,
but in credit very secondary, office of
cruising off Brest, to prevent interruption by the
French ships there; to play, in short, the incon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>spicuous
r&ocirc;le of a covering force, while the light
squadron had the brilliant part of fighting. The
officer selected for the latter was Howe, deservedly
a favorite of Hawke's, but not therefore acceptable
to him as a supplanter in his honors.</p>

<p>The admiral had been for some time superintending
the equipment of the vessels for the light
division, when, on May 10, 1758, Howe reported
to him, bringing his orders. Hawke boiled over
at once; and, in a heat evidently beyond his
will to control, despatched the following letter,
three hours after Howe's arrival.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Portsmouth</span>, 7 o'clock p.m. 10th May, 1758.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;About 4 o'clock arrived here Captain Howe,
and delivered me their Lordships' order of the 9th. In
last September I was sent out to command an expedition
under all the disadvantages one could possibly
labor under, arising chiefly from my being under the
influence of land-officers in Councils of War at sea.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Last cruise (March-April, 1758) I went out on a particular
service, almost without the least means of performing
it. Now every means to ensure success is provided;
another is to reap the credit; while it is probable that
I, with the capital ships, might be ordered to cruise in
such a manner as to prevent his failing in this attempt.
To fit out his ships for this service I have been kept
here,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and even now have their Lordships' directions, at
least in terms, to obey him. He is to judge of what he
wants for his expedition; he is to make his demands,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>and I am to comply with them. I have therefore
directed my flag immediately to be struck, and left their
Lordships' orders with Vice-Admiral Holburne. For
no consequence that can attend my striking it without
orders shall ever outbalance with me the wearing it one
moment with discredit.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am, etc.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E. HAWKE.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is impossible to justify so extreme a step as
abandoning one's command without permission,
and especially under circumstances that permitted
the orderly course of asking for detachment.
Nevertheless, Hawke did well to be angry; and,
as is sometimes the case, an injudicious and, in
point of occasion, unseemly loss of temper, doubtless
contributed to insure for him in the future, to
a degree which forbearance or mere remonstrance
would not have assured, the consideration essential
to his duties. Many will remember the effect
produced by Plimsoll's unparliamentary outbreak.
The erroneous impression, that admirals and generals
fit to be employed at all were to be ridden
booted and spurred, needed correction. Hawke
had misapprehended the intention of the Government,
in so far as believing that the light squadron
was to be employed in Basque Roads, the scene
of last year's failure; but he was right in thinking
that intrusting the enterprise to another, on that
occasion his junior, would be a reflection upon
himself, intensified by making the command
practically independent, while he was limited to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the covering duty. Under these circumstances,
erroneously imagined by him, the squadron should
have been attached to his command, and the
particular direction left to him; the Government
giving to him, instead of to Howe, the general
orders which it issued, and arranging with him
beforehand as to the command of the detached
squadron.</p>

<p>But even under the actual conditions, of an
intention to operate on the western Channel coast
of France, it would have been graceful and appropriate
to recognize Hawke's eminent past, and
recent experience, by keeping under his command
the ships he had himself fitted for the service, and
directing him to despatch Howe with the necessary
instructions. It was as in the Nile campaign,
where the general directions were sent to St.
Vincent, with a clear expression of the Government's
preference for Nelson as the officer to take
charge. The intended scene of Howe's operations,
if not formally within Hawke's district, was
far less distant from Brest than Toulon and Italy
were from Cadiz, where St. Vincent covered Nelson's
detachment. In the wish for secrecy, perhaps,
or perhaps through mere indifference to the
effect produced upon Hawke, as a man assumed
to need curb and spur, he was left in ignorance,
to imagine what he pleased; and this action, succeeding
previous neglects and Pitt's imputations
of the previous year, elicited an outburst which,
while it cannot be justified in its particular mani<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>festation,
was in spirit inevitable. A man submissive
to such treatment as he had good cause
to suspect, would be deficient in the independence
of character, and sensitive regard to official reputation,
without which he was unfit to command
the Channel Fleet.</p>

<p>Hawke was summoned at once to the Admiralty,
and in the interview which ensued, as shown
by the minutes endorsed on his own letter, his
misconception as to the quarter in which Howe
was to act afforded standing ground for a compromise.
Hawke having committed himself
officially, and upon a mistaken premise, the
Admiralty had him technically at their mercy;
but such a triumph as they could win by disciplining
him would be more disastrous than a
defeat. He disclaimed resentment towards any
person, and reiterated that his action was intended
merely to defend his character and honor,
which he said&mdash;to quote the minute exactly&mdash;"were
not <i>so much</i> touched as he apprehended
when the suspicion he had of Mr. Howe's going
to Basque Roads arose&mdash;from the Lords asking
him some days since for a draft of the Roads."
The italics are the present writer's; but the words
as they stand would indicate that he did not yield
his view of the matter in general, nor leave
hearers under any doubt as to how far he could
safely be treated with contumely or slight. There
can be little doubt that the substantial result
was to strengthen his position in the exact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>ing
duty that lay before him in the following
year.</p>

<p>The whole business was then salved over
by the First Lord, Anson, taking command of
the Channel Fleet for the particular occasion.
Hawke accompanied him as second in command,
while Howe went his way with the light squadron
and the troops. Both divisions sailed on the 1st
of June. On the 18th our admiral was so unwell
with a severe fever and cold&mdash;a complaint to
which he was much subject&mdash;that he had to ask
to be sent into port. He went ashore before the
end of the month, and remained unemployed till
the following May.</p>

<p>The year 1759 is the culminating epoch of
Hawke's career. In it occurred the signal triumph
of Quiberon Bay, the seal of his genius,
significant above all as demonstrating that the
ardor of the leader had found fulfilment in his
followers, that the spirit of Hawke had become
the spirit of the Navy. This year also yielded
proof of his great capacity as a seaman and administrator,
in the efficient blocking of Brest,
prolonged through six months of closest watching
into the period of the winter gales, in face of
which it had hitherto been thought impossible to
keep the sea with heavy ships massed in fleets;
for, as he most justly said, in explaining the
necessity of maintaining the rendezvous fixed by
him, "A single ship may struggle with a hard
gale of wind when a squadron cannot. In work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>ing
against a strong westerly gale in the Channel,
where it cannot make very long stretches,"&mdash;because
it finds shores and shoals on either side,&mdash;"it
must always by wearing lose ground, but
more especially if it should so blow as to put it
past carrying sail." The method used by Hawke
was not only an innovation on all past practice,
but, as has before been said, constituted the pattern
whereon were framed the great blockades of
the Napoleonic period, which strangled both the
naval efficiency and the commercial and financial
resources of the Empire. These were but developments
of Hawke's fine achievement of 1759;
the prestige of originality belongs to him. Even
their success, with better ships and the improvement
of detail always accompanying habit, is foreshadowed
by his. "I may safely affirm that,
except the few ships that took refuge in Conquet,
hardly a vessel of any kind has been able to enter
or come out of Brest for four months,"&mdash;ending
October 10th. "They have been obliged to unload
near forty victuallers at Quimperley and
carry their cargoes by land to Brest. It must
be the fault of the weather, not ours, if any of
them escape."</p>

<p>It was suitable indeed that so strenuous and
admirable an exhibition of professional ability,&mdash;of
naval generalship,&mdash;alike in strategic combination,
tactical disposition, and administrative
superintendence, should terminate in a brilliant
triumph, at once its fruit and its crown; wherein<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
sedulous and unremittent readiness for instant
action, comprehended by few, received a startling
demonstration which none could fail to understand.
As Nelson was pursued by ignorant sneers before
the Nile, so Hawke was burned in effigy by the
populace, at the very moment when laborious
effort was about to issue in supreme achievement.
The victory in either case is less than the antecedent
labor, as the crown, after all, is less than
the work, the symbol than the fact symbolized.</p>

<p>A brief account of preceding conditions, and
of the dispositions maintained to meet them, is
therefore necessary to due appreciation of the
victory of Quiberon Bay. Although the diversions
of 1758 had not very materially aided
Frederic of Prussia, they had inflicted distinct
humiliation and harassment upon France. This,
added to defeat upon the Continent and in North
America, had convinced the French Government,
as it convinced Napoleon a half-century later, that
a determined blow must be struck at England
herself as the operative centre upon which rested,
and from which proceeded, the most serious
detriment to their cause and that of their allies.
It was resolved, therefore, to attempt an invasion
of England; to the threat of which the English
people were always extremely sensitive.</p>

<p>From local conditions the French preparations
had to be made in several separate places; it was
the task of the British Navy to prevent the concentration
of these different detachments in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
joint effort. The troops must embark, of course,
from some place near to England; their principal
points of assembly were on the Channel, whence
they were to cross in flat-boats, and in the Biscay
ports, from Brest to the mouth of the Loire.
The Bay of Quiberon, from which Hawke's action
takes its name, lies between the two latter
points. It is sheltered from the full force of the
Atlantic gales by a peninsula of the same name,
and by some shoals which prolong the barrier
to the southward of the promontory.</p>

<p>To cross safely, it was necessary to provide
naval protection. To this end squadrons were
equipped in Toulon and in Brest. Combined at
the latter point, and further strengthened by
divisions expected to return from North America,
they would constitute a force of very serious consideration
in point of numbers. Rochefort also
was an element in the problem, though a minor
one; for either the small force already there
might join the concentration, or, if the port were
unwatched, the American or other divisions
might get in there, and be at least so much
nearer to Brest, or to a neighboring point of
assembly, as Quiberon Bay.</p>

<p>As the French Navy was essential to the
French crossing, as its junction was essential to
action, as the point of junction was at or near
Brest&mdash;for there was the district near which the
troops were assembling&mdash;and as by far the
largest detachment was already in Brest, that port<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
became the important centre upon blocking which
depended primarily the thwarting of the invasion.
If the French Navy succeeded in concentrating
at Brest, the first move in the game would be lost.
Hawke therefore had the double duty of not allowing
the squadron there to get out without fighting,
and of closing the entrance to reinforcements.
The latter was far the more difficult, and could
not be assured beyond the chance of failure,
because an on-shore gale, which would carry his
fleet into the Channel to avoid being driven on
the French coast, would be fair for an outside
enemy to run into the port, friendly to him.
This actually occurred at a most critical moment,
but it could only happen by a combination of
circumstances; that is, by the hostile squadron
chancing to arrive at a moment when the British
had been blown off. If it approached under ordinary
conditions of weather it would run into the
midst of foes.</p>

<p>The great names of the British Navy were
then all afloat in active command. Rodney was
before Havre, which he bombarded in the course
of the summer, doing a certain amount of damage,
harassing the local preparations for invasion,
and intercepting vessels carrying supplies to the
Brest fleet and coastwise. Boscawen, second only
to Hawke, was before Toulon, to hold there
the dozen ships-of-the-line under De la Clue, as
Hawke was charged to stop the score under
Conflans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>In broad conception, Hawke's method was
simple and can be easily stated; the difficulty
lay in carrying it out. The main body of his
force had a rendezvous, so chosen that in violent
weather from the westward it could at worst
drift up Channel, but usually would have a fair
wind for Torbay, a roadstead on the British
coast about a hundred miles distant. To the
rendezvous the fleet was not tied under ordinary
circumstances; it was merely a headquarters
which admitted of cruising, but where despatches
from home would always find the admiral in person,
or news of his whereabouts. Near Brest
itself was kept an inshore squadron of three or
four ships, which under ordinary circumstances
could see the enemy inside, noting his forwardness;
for the cannon of the day could not molest
a vessel more than a mile from the entrance,
while the conditions within of spars and sails
indicated to a seaman the readiness or intention
to move, to a degree not ascertainable with ships
dependent on steam only.</p>

<p>With these dispositions, if a westerly gale
came on, the fleet held its ground while it could,
but when expedient to go put into Torbay. Owing
to the nearness of the two places, the weather,
when of a pronounced character, was the same
at both. While the wind held to the westward
of south, or even at south-southeast, a ship-of-the-line
could not beat out from Brest; much less a
fleet. The instant the wind went east, fair for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
exit, the British left Torbay, with certainty of
not being too late; for, though the enemy might
get out before their return, the east wind would
not suffer them to close with the French coast
at another point soon enough to avoid a meeting.
While in Torbay the time was improved by
taking on board stores and provisions; nor was
the night's rest at anchor a small consideration
for seamen worn with continual cruising.</p>

<p>The practical merits displayed by Hawke in
maintaining this simple but arduous service were,
first and supremely, the recognition of its possibility,
contrary to a tradition heretofore as commonly
and as blindly accepted as those of the
line-of-battle, and of the proper methods for fleet
attack before described. It must be remembered
also that in these wars, 1739-1763, for the first
time the British Navy found the scene of action,
in European waters, to be the Biscay coast of
France. In the former great wars of the seventeenth
century, French fleets entered the Channel,
and pitched battles were fought there and in
the North Sea. Thence the contest shifted
to the Mediterranean, where the great fleets
operated in the later days of William III., and the
reign of Anne. Then, too, the heavy ships, like
land armies, went into winter quarters. It was
by distinguished admirals considered professionally
criminal to expose those huge yet cumbrous
engines of the nation's power to the buffetings
of winter gales, which might unfit them next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
year to meet the enemy, snugly nursed and
restored to vigor in home ports during the same
time. The need of periodical refitting and cleaning
the bottoms clinched the argument in favor
of this seasonable withdrawal from the sea.</p>

<p>With this presumed necessity, attention had
not been paid to developing a system of maintenance
and refit adapted to the need of a fleet performing
what Hawke undertook. In this, of
course, there cannot be assigned to him the individuality
of merit that may belong to a conception,
and does belong to the man who initiates
and assumes, as he did, the responsibility for a
novel and hazardous course of action. Many
agents had to contribute to the forwarding of
supplies and repairs; but, while singleness of
credit cannot be assumed, priority is justly due to
him upon whose shoulders fell not only all blame,
in case his enterprise failed, but the fundamental
difficulty of so timing the reliefs of the vessels
under his command, so arranging the order of
rotation in their going and coming as to keep
each, as well as the whole body, in a constant condition
of highest attainable efficiency&mdash;in numbers,
in speed, and in health&mdash;for meeting the
enemy, whose time of exit could not be foreknown.
Naturally, too, the man on whom all this fell, and
who to the nation would personify success or
failure, as the event might be,&mdash;terms which to
him would mean honor or ruin,&mdash;that man, when
professionally so competent as Hawke, would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
most fruitful in orders and in suggestions to attain
the desired end. In this sense there can be no
doubt that he was foremost, and his correspondence
bears evidence of his preoccupation with
the subject.</p>

<p>Into particulars it is scarcely necessary to go.
Administrative details are interesting only to
specialists. But one quality absolutely essential,
and in which most men fail, he manifested in high
degree. He feared no responsibility, either
towards the enemy, or towards the home authorities.
Superior and inferior alike heard plainly
from him in case of defects; still more plainly in
case of neglect. "It is a matter of indifference
to me whether I fight the enemy, should they
come out, with an equal number, one ship more,
or one ship less." "I depend not on intelligence
from the French ports; what I see I believe, and
regulate my conduct accordingly;" a saying which
recalls one of Farragut's,&mdash;"The officers say I
don't believe anything. I certainly believe very
little that comes in the shape of reports. They
keep everybody stirred up. I mean to be whipped
or to whip my enemy, and not to be scared
to death." Agitation, to a very considerable
degree, was the condition of Hawke's superiors;
to say the least, anxiety strained to the point of
approaching panic. But Hawke could have
adopted truly as his own Farragut's other words,
"I have full confidence in myself and in my judgment,"&mdash;that
is, of course, in professional mat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>ters;
and he spoke reassuringly out of the firmness
of his self-reliance. "Their Lordships will pardon
me for observing that from the present disposition
of the squadron I think there is little room for
alarm while the weather continues tolerable."
Again, a few days later, "Their Lordships may
rest assured there is little foundation for the present
alarms. While the wind is fair for the
enemy's coming out, it is also favorable for our
keeping them in; and while we are obliged to
keep off they cannot stir." This was in October,
when the weather was already wild and the days
shortening.</p>

<p>With equally little hesitancy, though without
breach of subordination, he overbears the Admiralty
when they wish to pay what he considers
exaggerated care to cleaning the bottoms, traceable,
no doubt, to the prejudices of the Sea Lords.
"If the ships take up a month by cleaning, from
the time they leave me to their return, it will be
impossible for me to keep up the squadron. The
only practicable way is to heel, etc., and confine
them to ten days in port for the refreshment of
their companies in case they should miss the
spring tide." "Their Lordships will give me leave
to observe that the relief of the squadron depends
more on the refreshment of the ships' companies
than on cleaning the ships. By the hurry the
latter must be performed in, unless the ship continues
a month or five weeks in port, which the
present exigency will by no means admit of, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
men would be so harassed and fatigued that they
would return to me in a worse condition than
when they left me.... However, I shall endeavor
to comply with all their Lordships' directions in
such manner as, <i>to the best of my judgment, will
answer their intentions in employing me here</i>."
The words italicized strike the true note of subordination
duly tempered with discretion.</p>

<p>To the Navy Board, a civil adjunct to the
Admiralty, but possessed of considerable independent
power to annoy officers in active military
service, he took a more peremptory tone. He
had discharged on his own authority, and for reasons
of emergency, a mutinous surgical officer.
For this he was taken to task, as Nelson a generation
later was rebuked by the same body. "I
have to acquaint you," he replied, "that there was
no mistake in his being ordered by me to be discharged."
He then gives his reasons, and continues,
"For the real good of the service I ordered
him to be discharged, and his crime noted on his
list of pay, for your information. I shall not enter
into any dispute with you about my authority as
a Commanding Officer, neither do I ever think of
inconveniences or prejudices to myself, as a party,
according to your insinuations, where the good of
the service is concerned." It must be added that
to subordinates he was as liberal with praise as he
was with censure, where either was merited; nor
did he fail in kindly personal intervention upon
due occasion for deserving or unfortunate men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
More reserved, apparently, than Nelson, he seems
to have been like him sympathetic; and hence it
was that, as before observed, it was his spirit that
he communicated to the navy rather than a system,
admirable as was the strategic system embodied
in his methods of blockade. It was by personal
influence rather than by formulated precept that
Hawke inspired his service, and earned a just claim
to be reckoned the greatest force of his century
in naval development.</p>

<p>The general conditions being as described, the
fighting in the naval campaign of 1759 began in
the Mediterranean. On June 8th Boscawen, having
driven two French frigates into a fortified bay
near Toulon, attacked them with three ships-of-the-line.
The attack failed, and the British ships
were badly injured; a timely lesson on the general
inexpediency of attacking shore batteries with
vessels, unless for special and adequate reasons
of probable advantage. In July he returned to
Gibraltar, to refit and for provisions. In the
absence of details, positive criticism is unwarranted;
but it is impossible not to note the difference
between this step, during summer weather,
and the Toulon blockades of Lord St. Vincent,
who, when before Brest, modelled his course upon
that of Hawke. The port being thus left open,
De la Clue sailed on the 5th of August for Brest.
On the 17th he was near the straits of Gibraltar,
hugging the African coast, and falling night gave
promise of passing unseen, when a British look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>out
frigate caught sight of his squadron. She
hauled in for Gibraltar at once, firing signal guns.
Boscawen's ships were in the midst of repairs, mostly
dismantled; but, the emergency not being unforeseen,
spars and sails were sent rapidly aloft, and
within three hours they were underway in pursuit.
The French division separated during the night.
Five ships put into Cadiz. The British next
morning caught sight of the remaining seven,
among which was the admiral, and a sharp chase
resulted in the destruction of five. From August
18th the Toulon fleet was eliminated from the campaign;
though the vessels in Cadiz remained to
the end a charge upon Hawke's watchfulness,
similar to that caused by the enemy's divisions
expected from America.</p>

<p>That one of the latter was already on its way
home, under the command of Commodore Bompart,
was notified to our admiral on September
21st by a despatch from England. He immediately
sent a division of heavy ships to reinforce
the light squadron to the southward. "If the
alarm is great now," he said, "it will be much
greater if he get into Rochefort." Further information
from the West Indies contradicted the
first report, and on October 10th Hawke recalled
the ships-of-the-line, apparently at the wish of the
Admiralty; for he expresses his regret at doing
so, and asks for more of the "many ships" then
in England, that Rochefort may be blocked as
well as Brest. The incident has now little impor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>tance,
except as indicating the general national
nervousness, and the difficulty under which he
labored through force inadequate to the numerous
and exacting duties entailed by constant holding
the sea in war. From this point of view it bears
upon his conduct.</p>

<p>That Bompart was coming proved to be true.
On November 10th Hawke anchored with the fleet
in Torbay, after three days of struggle against a
very heavy westerly storm. "Bompart, if near,
may get in," he wrote the Admiralty, "but no
ship can get out from any port in the Bay." The
weather had then moderated, but was still too
rough for boating, even in the sheltered roadstead;
hence he could get no reports of the state of the
ships, which shows incidentally the then defective
system of signalling. On the 12th he sailed, on
the 13th was again forced into Torbay by a south-wester,
but on the 14th got away finally. On the
afternoon of the 16th the fleet was twenty-five
miles from the Island of Ushant, near Brest, and
there learned from transports, returning from the
light division off Quiberon, that the French
fleet had been seen the day before, seventy-five
miles northwest of Belleisle; therefore some fifty
or sixty miles southeast of the point where this
news was received. Conflans had sailed the same
day that the British last left Torbay, but before
his departure Bompart had opportunely arrived,
as Hawke had feared. His ships were not able
to go at once to sea on so important a mission,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
but their seasoned crews were a welcome reinforcement
and were distributed through the main fleet,
which numbered twenty-one ships-of-the-line.
Hawke had twenty-three.</p>

<p>Concluding that the enemy were bound for
Quiberon, Hawke carried a press of sail for that
place. He knew they must be within a hundred
miles of him and aimed to cut them off from their
port. During the 17th the wind, hanging to the
south and east, was adverse to both fleets, but on
the 18th and 19th it became more favorable. At
half-past eight on the morning of the 20th, one of
the lookout frigates ahead of the British made
the signal for sighting a fleet. It was then blowing
strong from the west-northwest, and Belleisle,
which is ten miles west of Quiberon Bay, and
south of which the fleets must pass, was by the
English reckoning forty miles distant. A course
of some fifty or sixty miles was therefore to be
run before the enemy could close the land, and
there remained about eight hours of sun.</p>

<p>Hawke's day had come. Towards ten o'clock
he had the enemy sufficiently in view to see that
they were intent upon securing their arrival,
rather than fighting. He therefore made signal
for the seven ships nearest them "to chase and
draw into a line-of-battle ahead of me, and endeavour
to stop them till the rest of the squadron
should come up, who also were <i>to form as they
chased that no time might be lost</i> in the pursuit."
The French "kept going off under such sail as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
all their squadron could carry and <i>yet keep together</i>,
while we crowded after him <i>with every sail
our ships could bear</i>." The words italicized sum
up the whole philosophy of a general chase.
The pursued are limited to the speed of the
slowest, otherwise he who cannot but lag is
separated and lost; the pursuer need slacken
no whit, for his friends are ever coming up to
his aid. Overtaking is inevitable, unless the distance
is too short.</p>

<p>At half-past two firing began between the
French rear and the leading British. Of the two
foremost in the chase, who thus opened the fight,
one was the same <i>Dorsetshire</i> which in Mathews's
battle had played the laggard. Her captain, who
thus rose to his opportunity, was one of the two
to whom Hawke addressed the enthusiastic compliment
that they had "behaved like angels."
Hawke himself was at this moment south of
Belleisle, with several ships ahead of him; while
the French admiral was leading his fleet, in order
better to pilot them over dangerous ground, and
by his own action show more surely than was
possible by signal what he wished done from
moment to moment. At the southern extreme of
the shoals which act as a breakwater to Quiberon
Bay are some formidable rocks, known as the
Cardinals. Around these M. de Conflans passed
soon after the firing began, his rear being then in
hot action.</p>

<p>Hawke himself was without a pilot, as were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
most of his captains. The sailing master of the
flag-ship was charged with that duty for the fleet,
but had of the ground before him no exact personal
knowledge; nor could reliance be placed
upon the imperfect surveys of a locality, which
it was not the interest of an almost constant
enemy to disclose. Enough, however, was known
to leave no doubt of the greatness of the risks,
and it was the master's part to represent them.
The occasion, however, was not one of a mere
diversion, of a secondary operation, but of one
vital to the nation's cause; and Hawke's reply,
stamped with the firmness of a great officer,
showed how little professional timidity had to
do with his laudable care of his fleet in Basque
Roads two years before. "You have done your
duty in warning me," he replied; "now lay us
alongside the French Commander-in-chief." So
amid the falling hours of the day the British fleet,
under the unswerving impulse of its leader, moved
steadfastly forward, to meet a combination of
perils that embraced all most justly dreaded by
seamen,&mdash;darkness, an intricate navigation, a
lee shore fringed with outlying and imperfectly
known reefs and shoals, towards which they were
hurried by a fast-rising wind and sea, that forbade
all hope of retracing their steps during the
long hours of the night.</p>

<p>"Had we but two hours more daylight," wrote
Hawke in his official report, "the whole had been
totally destroyed or taken; for we were almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
up with their van when night overtook us." His
success would have been greater, though not
more decisive of issues than the event proved it;
but nothing could have added to the merit or
brilliancy of his action, to which no element of
grandeur was wanting. This was one of the
most dramatic of sea fights. Forty-odd tall
ships, pursuers and pursued, under reefed canvas,
in fierce career drove furiously on; now rushing
headlong down the forward slope of a great sea,
now rising on its crest as it swept beyond them;
now seen, now hidden; the helmsmen straining
at the wheels, upon which the huge hulls, tossing
their prows from side to side, tugged like a maddened
horse, as though themselves feeling the
wild "rapture of the strife" that animated their
masters, rejoicing in their strength and defying
the accustomed rein.</p>

<p>The French admiral had flattered himself that
the enemy, ignorant of the ground, would not
dare to follow him round the Cardinals. He was
soon undeceived. Hawke's comment on the
situation was that he was "for the old way of
fighting, to make downright work with them."
It was an old way, true; but he had more than
once seen it lost to mind, and had himself
done most to restore it to its place,&mdash;a new way
as well as an old. The signals for the general
chase and for battle were kept aloft, and no
British ship slacked her way. Without ranged
order, save that of speed, the leaders mingled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
with the French rear; the roar and flashes of
the guns, the falling spars and drifting clouds of
smoke, now adding their part to the wild magnificence
of the scene. Though tactically perfect
in the sole true sense of tactics, that the means
adopted exactly suited the situation, this was a
battle of incidents, often untold,&mdash;not one of
manoeuvres. As the ships, rolling heavily, buried
their flanks deeply in the following seas, no captain
dared to open his lower tier of ports, where
the most powerful artillery was arrayed&mdash;none
save one, the French <i>Th&eacute;s&eacute;e</i>, whose rashness was
rebuked by the inpouring waters, which quickly
engulfed both ship and crew. The <i>Superbe</i> met
a like fate, though not certainly from the same
cause. She sank under the broadside of the
<i>Royal George</i>, Hawke's flag-ship. "The <i>Royal
George's</i> people gave a cheer," wrote an eye witness,
"but it was a faint one; the honest sailors
were touched at the miserable state of so many
hundreds of poor creatures." Americans and
English can couple this story of long ago with
Philip's ejaculation off Santiago de Cuba, but
three years since: "Don't cheer, boys, those
poor devils are dying."</p>

<p>By five o'clock two French ships had struck,
and two had been sunk. "Night was now come,"
wrote Hawke, "and being on a part of the coast,
among islands and shoals of which we were
totally ignorant, without a pilot, as was the
greatest part of the squadron, and blowing hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
on a lee shore, I made the signal to anchor."
The day's work was over, and doubtless looked to
him incomplete, but it was effectually and finally
done. The French Navy did not again lift up
its head during the three years of war that
remained. Balked in their expectation that the
foe's fear of the beach would give them refuge,
harried and worried by the chase, harnessed to no
fixed plan of action, Conflans's fleet broke apart
and fled. Seven went north, and ran ashore at
the mouth of the little river Vilaine which empties
into Quiberon Bay. Eight stood south, and
succeeded in reaching Rochefort. The fate of
four has been told. Conflans's flag-ship anchored
after night among the British, but at daybreak
next morning cut her cables, ran ashore, and was
burned by the French. One other, wrecked on a
shoal in the bay, makes up the tale of twenty-one.
Six were wholly lost to their navy; the seven
that got into Vilaine only escaped to Brest by
twos, two years later, while the Rochefort division
was effectually blocked by occupying Basque
Roads, the islands of which and of Quiberon
were cultivated as kitchen gardens for the refreshment
of British crews.</p>

<p>Of the British, one ship went on a shoal during
the action, and on the following day another
coming to her assistance also grounded. Both
were lost, but most of their people were saved.
Beyond this Hawke's fleet suffered little. "As
to the loss we have sustained," wrote he, "let it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
be placed to the account of the necessity I was
under of running all risks to break this strong
force of the enemy."</p>

<p>A contemporary witness assigns to Hawke's
own ship a large individual share in the fighting.
Of this he does not himself speak, nor is it
of much matter. That all was done with her
that could be done, to aid in achieving success,
is sufficiently assured by his previous record.
Hawke's transcendent merit in this affair was
that of the general officer, not of the private
captain. The utmost courage shown by the
commander of a single ship before the enemy's
fire cannot equal the heroism which assumes the
immense responsibility of a doubtful issue, on
which may hang a nation's fate; nor would the
admiral's glory be shorn of a ray, if neither then
nor at any other time had a hostile shot traversed
his decks.</p>

<p>The night of the 20th passed in anxieties
inseparable from a situation dangerous at best,
but still more trying to an admiral upon whom,
after such a day, night had closed without enabling
him to see in what case most of his ships
were. "In the night," he reports, "we heard
many guns of distress fired, but, blowing hard,
want of knowledge of the coast, and whether they
were fired by a friend or an enemy, prevented all
means of relief." In the morning he resumed
his activity. Little, however, could be done.
The continuing violence of the wind, and igno<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>rance
of the ground, prevented approach within
gun-shot to the ships at the mouth of the Vilaine,
while they, by lightening and favor of the next
flood tide, warped their way inside through the
mud flats.</p>

<p>Hawke remained nearly two months longer, returning
to England January 17, 1760. He had
then been thirty-five weeks on board, without setting
foot on shore. At the age of fifty-four, and
amid such manifold cares, it is not to be wondered
at that he should need relief. Rather must he be
considered fortunate that his health, never robust
in middle life, held firm till his great triumph was
achieved. Boscawen succeeded him temporarily
in the command.</p>

<p>He was received in England with acclamations
and with honors; yet the most conspicuous mark
of approval conferred on admirals before and after,
the grant of the peerage, was not given to him,
who had wrought one of the very greatest services
ever done for the country. Recent precedent&mdash;that
of Anson&mdash;demanded such recognition; and
popular enthusiasm would have applauded,
although the full military merit of the man could
scarcely be appreciated by the standards of his
generation. That no such reward was bestowed is
most probably attributable to Hawke's own indifference
to self-advancement. If demanded by him,
it could scarcely have been refused; but he never
pushed his own interests. His masculine independence
in professional conduct, towards supe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>riors
and inferiors, found its root and its reflection
in personal unconcern&mdash;as well antecedent as
subsequent&mdash;about the results from his actions
to his fortunes. To do his own part to the
utmost, within the lines of the profession he knew,
was his conception of duty. As he would not
meddle with the land officers' decision as to what
they should or should not do, so he left to the
politicians, in whose hands the gifts lay, to decide
what they would, or should, accord to a successful
admiral. Pitt, the Great Commoner, left
Hawke a commoner. Possibly he recognized
that only by stretch of imagination could Hawke
be reckoned one of the creations of a great Minister's
genius.</p>

<p>Little remains to tell. On September 3,
1762, the admiral's flag was hauled down for the
last time. He never went to sea again. In 1766,
when Pitt came back to power as Lord Chatham,
Hawke became First Lord of the Admiralty, and
so remained till 1771. It was a time of unbroken
peace, succeeding a period of continuous wars
extending over a quarter of a century; consequently
there was in naval and military matters
the lassitude usual to such a period. Hawke is
credited with formulating the principle that "the
British fleet could only be termed considerable in
the proportion it bore to that of the House of
Bourbon;" that is, to the combined navies of
France and Spain, over which that House then
reigned. The maxim proves that he had some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
claim to statesmanship in his view of affairs outside
his service; and his manifested freedom from
self-seeking is the warrant that no secondary political
motives would divert his efforts from this aim.
That he succeeded in the main, that he was not responsible
for the fallen condition of the fleet when
war again arose in 1778, is evidenced by a statement,
uncontradicted, in the House of Lords in
1779, that when he left office the navy had 139
ships-of-the-line, of which 81 were ready for
sea.</p>

<p>In 1765 Hawke, who was then already a full
admiral, wearing his flag at the mainmast head,
was made Vice-Admiral of Great Britain; an
honorary position, but the highest in point of
naval distinction that the nation had to give. As
one who held it three-quarters of a century later
wrote, "It has ever been regarded as the most
distinguished compliment belonging to our profession."
The coincidence is significant that
upon Hawke's death Rodney succeeded him in
it; affirming, as it were, the consecutiveness of
paramount influence exercised by the two on the
development of the Navy. In 1776 the peerage
was at last conferred; seventeen years after his
great victory, and when, having passed three score
and ten, a man who had ever disdained to ask must
have felt the honor barren to himself, though
acceptable for his son.</p>

<p>His last recorded professional utterances are in
private letters addressed in the summer of 1780<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
to the commander-in-chief of the Channel Fleet&mdash;Francis
Geary&mdash;who had served with him in
the Bay of Biscay, though he missed Quiberon.
He recommends the maintenance of his old
station off Brest, and says, "For God's sake, if
you should be so lucky as to get sight of the
enemy, get as close to them as possible. Do not
let them shuffle with you by engaging at a distance,
but get within musket shot if you can.
This will be the means to make the action decisive."
In these words we find an unbroken chain
of tradition between Hawke and Nelson. One of
Hawke's pupils was William Locker; and Locker
in turn, just before Hawke's death, had Nelson for
a lieutenant. To him Nelson in after years, in
the height of his glory, wrote, "To you, my dear
friend, I owe much of my success. It was you
who taught me,&mdash;'Lay a Frenchman close and
you will beat him.'"</p>

<p>Hawke died October 16, 1781. On his tomb
appear these words, "Wherever he sailed, victory
attended him." It is much to say, but it is not
all. Victory does not always follow desert. "It
is not in mortals to command success,"&mdash;a favorite
quotation with the successful admirals St. Vincent
and Nelson. Hawke's great and distinctive
glory is this,&mdash;that he, more than any one man,
was the source and origin of the new life, the new
spirit, of his service. There were many brave
men before him, as there were after; but it fell to
him in a time of great professional prostration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
not only to lift up and hand on a fallen torch, but
in himself to embody an ideal and an inspiration
from which others drew, thus rekindling a light
which it is scarcely an exaggeration to say had
been momentarily extinguished.</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="RODNEY" id="RODNEY"></a>RODNEY</h2>

<h4>1719-1792</h4>

<p>Unlike Hawke, Rodney drew his descent
from the landed gentry of England, and
had relatives among the aristocracy. The name
was originally Rodeney. We are told by his son-in-law
and biographer that the Duke of Chandos,
a connection by marriage, obtained the command
of the Royal yacht for the admiral's father, Henry
Rodney. In one of the trips which George I.
frequently made between England and Hanover,
he asked his captain if there were anything he
could do for him. The reply was a request that
he would stand sponsor for his son, who accordingly
received the name of George; his second
name Brydges coming from the family through
which Chandos and the Rodneys were brought
into relationship. The social position and surroundings
resulting from such antecedents contributed
of course to hasten the young officer's
advancement, irrespective of the unquestionable
professional merit shown by him, even in early
years; but to them also, combined with narrow
personal fortune, inadequate to the tastes thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
engendered, was probably due the pecuniary embarrassment
which dogged him through life, and
was perhaps the moving incentive to doubtful
procedures that cast a cloud upon his personal
and official reputation.</p>

<p>Rodney was born in February, 1719, and went
to sea at the age of thirteen; serving for seven
years in the Channel Fleet. Thence he was
transferred to the Mediterranean, where he was
made lieutenant in 1739. In 1742 he went again
to the Mediterranean with Admiral Mathews,
who there gave him command of a "post" ship,
with which he brought home the trade,&mdash;three
hundred merchant vessels,&mdash;from Lisbon. Upon
arriving in England his appointment by Mathews
was "confirmed" by the Admiralty. Being then
only twenty-four, he anticipated by five years the
age at which Hawke reached the same rank of
post-captain, the attainment of which fixed a man's
standing in the navy. Beyond that, advancement
went by seniority; a post-captain might be
"yellowed,"&mdash;retired as a rear admiral,&mdash;but
while in active service he kept the advantage of
his early promotion.</p>

<p>When Rodney was in later years commander-in-chief
in the West Indies, he made his son a
post-captain at fifteen; an exercise of official
powers which, though not singular to him, is
too characteristic of the man and the times to
be wholly unmentioned. His own promotion,
though rapid, was not too much so for his pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>fessional
good; but it is likely that neither that
consideration, nor the good of the service, counted
for much alongside of the influence he possessed.
He appears, however, to have justified from the
first the favor of his superiors. His employment
was continuous, and in a military point of view
he was more fortunate than Hawke was at the
same period of his career. Within two years,
when in command of a forty-gun ship, he fought
and took a French privateer of the same nominal
force, and with a crew larger by one hundred
than his own. Thence he was advanced into the
<i>Eagle</i>, sixty, in which, after some commerce-destroying
more lucrative than glorious, he bore
an extremely honorable part in Hawke's battle
with L'Etendu&egrave;re, already related. The <i>Eagle</i>
was heavily engaged, and was one of the three
small ships that on their own initiative pursued
and fought, though unsuccessfully, the two escaping
French vessels. Rodney shared Hawke's
general encomium, that "as far as fell within my
notice, the commanders, their officers, and ships'
companies, behaved with the greatest spirit and
resolution." Rodney came under his close observation,
for, the <i>Eagle's</i> "wheel being shot to
pieces and all the men at it killed, and all her
braces and bowlines gone," she drove twice on
board the flag-ship. This was before her pursuit
of the two fliers.</p>

<p>In the subsequent trial of Captain Fox,&mdash;the
minutes of which the present writer has not seen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>&mdash;it
appears, according to the biographer of
Lord Hawke,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that it was Captain Saunders's
and Captain Rodney's "sense of being deserted
by Fox, and of the two French ships having
escaped through his failure of duty, which forms
the chief feature of the Court-Martial. Rodney
especially describes his being exposed to the fire
of four of the enemy's ships, when, as he asserted,
Fox's ship might well have taken off some of it."
The incident is very noteworthy, for it bears the
impress of personal character. Intolerance of
dereliction of duty, and uncompromising condemnation
of the delinquent, were ever leading
traits in Rodney's course as a commander-in-chief.
He stood over his officers with a rod,
dealt out criticism unsparingly, and avowed it as
his purpose and principle of action so to rule.
It is not meant that his censures were undeserved,
or even excessive; but there entered into
them no ingredient of pity. His despatches are
full of complaints, both general and specific.
When he spared, it was from a sense of expediency,&mdash;or
of justice, a trait in which he was by
no means deficient; but for human weakness he
had no bowels. Hawke complains of but this
one captain, Fox, and towards him he seems not
to have evinced the strong feeling that animated
his juniors. Each man has his special gift, and
to succeed must needs act in accordance with it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>There are those who lead and those who drive;
Hawke belonged to the one class, Rodney to the
other.</p>

<p>In direct consequence of this difference of
temperament, it will be found, in contrasting the
schools of which Hawke and Rodney are the
conspicuous illustrations, that the first represents
the spirit, and the second the form, which were
the two efficient elements of the progress made
during the eighteenth century. The one introduces
into a service arrested in development,
petrified almost, by blindly accepted rules and
unintelligent traditions, a new impulse, which
transforms men from within, breaking through
the letter of the law in order to realize its forgotten
intent; the other gives to the spirit, thus
freed from old limitations, a fresh and sagacious
direction, but needs nevertheless to impose its
own methods by constraint from without. It is
the old struggle, ever renewed, between liberty
and law; in the due, but difficult, combination of
which consist both conservation and progress.</p>

<p>And so in the personality of the two great
admirals who respectively represent these contrasting
schools of practice; while we find in
both these two elements, as they must exist in
every efficient officer, yet it is to be said that the
one inspires and leads, the other moulds and compels.
The one, though seemingly reserved, is in
character sympathetic, and influences by example
chiefly; the other, austerely courteous, is towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
associates distant and ungenial, working by fear
rather than by love. For these broad reasons of
distinction it is Mathews's battle that best measures
the reaction of which Hawke is the type,
for there was especially illustrated defect of spirit,
to cover which the letter of the law was invoked;
whereas in Byng's action, extremely bad form, in
the attempt to conform to the letter of the Instructions,
emphasizes the contrast with Rodney's
methods, precise and formal unquestionably, but
in which form ceases to be an end in itself and
is reduced to its proper function as the means
to carry into effect a sound military conception.
Of these two factors in the century's progress, it
needs hardly to be said that the one contributed
by Hawke is the greater. In spirit and in achievement
he, rather than Rodney, is the harbinger of
Nelson.</p>

<p>A short time after the action with L'Etendu&egrave;re
the cruise of the <i>Eagle</i> came to an end. When
she was paid off Rodney was presented at Court
by Anson, the First Lord of the Admiralty; a
merited and not unusual honor after distinguished
service in battle. The King was struck by his
youthful appearance, and said he had not known
there was so young a captain in the Navy. As
he was then nearly thirty, and had seen much
and continuous service, it is singular that his
face should not have borne clear traces of the
facts. Anson replied that he had been a captain
for six years, and it was to be wished that His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Majesty had a hundred more as good as he.
Making allowance for courtly manners and fair-speaking,
the incident may be accepted as showing,
not only that aptitude for the service which
takes its hardships without undue wear and
tear, but also an official reputation already well
established and recognized.</p>

<p>Professional standing, therefore, as well as
family influence, probably contributed to obtain
for him in 1749 the appointment of Commodore
and Commander-in-chief on the Newfoundland
station; for he was still junior on the list of
captains, and had ten years more to run before
obtaining his admiral's flag. He remained in
this post from 1749 to 1752. They were years
of peace, but of peace charged full with the elements
of discord which led to the following war.
Canada was still French, and the territorial limits
between the North American possessions of the
two nations remained a subject of dispute and
intrigue. The uncertain state of political relations
around the Gulf of St. Lawrence added to
the responsibility of Rodney's duty, and emphasized
the confidence shown in assigning him a
position involving cautious political action.</p>

<p>Explicit confirmation of this indirect testimony
is found in a private letter to him from the Earl
of Sandwich, who had succeeded Anson as First
Lord in 1748. "I think it necessary to inform
you that, if the Governor of Nova Scotia should
have occasion to apply to you for succor, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
send to you for that purpose to Newfoundland, it
would be approved by Government if you should
comply with his request. It is judged improper,
as yet, to send any public order upon a business
of so delicate a nature, which is the reason of my
writing to you in this manner; and I am satisfied
that your prudence is such as will not suffer you
to make any injudicious use of the information
you now receive. There are some people that
cannot be trusted with any but public orders, but
I shall think this important affair entirely safe
under your management and secrecy." Language
such as this undoubtedly often covers a
hint, as well as expresses a compliment, and may
have done so in this instance; nevertheless, in
after life it is certain that Rodney gave proof of a
very high order of professional discretion and of
independent initiative. It is therefore perfectly
reasonable to suppose that he had thus early
convinced the Government that he was a man
competent and trustworthy under critical conditions,
such as then characterized the intercolonial
relations of the two states. The particular incident
is farther noteworthy in connection with the
backwardness, and even reluctance, of the Government
to employ him in the War of the American
Revolution, though Sandwich was again First
Lord, and Rodney a strong political supporter of
the party in power. The precise cause for this
is probably not ascertainable; but it is a matter
of perfectly reasonable inference that the early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
promise of the young officer had meanwhile
become overclouded, that distrust had succeeded
to confidence, for reasons professional, but not
strictly military. Rodney's war record continued
excellent from first to last; one not good only,
but of exceptional and singular efficiency.</p>

<p>In October, 1752, Rodney returned to England,
having been elected to Parliament. The Seven
Years War, which, after two years of irregular
hostilities, began formally in 1756, found him still
a captain. With its most conspicuous opening
incident, the attempted relief of Minorca, and
the subsequent trial and execution of the
unsuccessful commander, Admiral Byng, he had
no connection, personal or official; nor was he a
member of the Court-Martial, although he seems
to have been in England at the time, and was
senior to at least one of the sitting captains.
The abortive naval engagement off Port Mahon,
however, stands in a directly significant relation
to his career, for it exemplifies to the most exaggerated
degree, alike in the purpose of the admiral
and the finding of the Court, the formal and
pedantic conception of a correctly fought fleet
action, according to the rules and regulations "in
such cases prescribed" by the Fighting Instructions.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
It was Rodney's lot to break with this
tradition, and to be the first to illustrate juster
ideas in a fairly ranged battle, where the enemy
awaited attack, as he had done at Malaga in 1704,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and at Minorca in 1756. Precisely such an opportunity
never came to Hawke; for, although
L'Etendu&egrave;re waited, he did so under conditions
and dispositions which gave the ensuing affair
a nearer analogy to a general chase than to a
pitched battle. Though the British approach
then was in a general sense parallel to the
enemy's line, it was from the rear, not from the
beam; and through this circumstance of overtaking,
and from the method adopted, their vessels
came under fire in succession, not together.
This was perfectly correct, the course pre-eminently
suited to the emergency, and therefore
tactically most sound; but the conditions were
not those contemplated by the Fighting Instructions,
as they were in the case of Byng, and also
in the battle most thoroughly characteristic of
Rodney&mdash;that of April 17, 1780. The contrast
in conduct between the two commanders is strikingly
significant of progress, because of the close
approach to identity in circumstances.</p>

<p>Rodney accompanied the Rochefort expedition
of 1757, under Hawke, some account of which is
given in the life of that admiral; and he commanded
also a ship-of-the-line in Boscawen's fleet
in 1758, when the reduction of Louisburg and
Cape Breton Island was effected by the combined
British and colonial forces. After this important
service, the necessary and effectual antecedent of
the capture of Quebec and the fall of Canada in
the following year, he returned to England, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
on the 19th of May, 1759, he was promoted to
Rear Admiral; being then forty. He was next,
and without interval of rest, given command of a
squadron to operate against Havre, where were
gathering boats and munitions of war for the
threatened invasion of England; with the charge
also of suppressing the French coastwise sailings,
upon which depended the assembling of the various
bodies of transports, and the carriage of supplies
to the fleet in Brest, that Hawke at the
same time was holding in check. The service
was important, but of secondary interest, and
calls for no particular mention beyond that of its
general efficiency as maintained by him.</p>

<p>In 1761, Rodney was again elected to Parliament,
and, with a certain political inconsequence,
was immediately afterwards sent out of the country,
being appointed to the Leeward Islands
Station, which embraced the smaller Antilles, on
the eastern side of the Caribbean Sea, with headquarters
at Barbados; Jamaica, to the westward,
forming a distinct command under an admiral of
its own. He sailed for his new post October 21,
1761, taking with him instructions to begin operations
against Martinique upon the arrival of troops
ordered from New York. These reached Barbados
December 24th, a month after himself, and
on the 7th of January, 1762, the combined forces
were before Martinique, which after a month of
regular operations passed into the possession of
the British on the 16th of February. Its fall was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
followed shortly by that of the other French Lesser
Antilles,&mdash;Grenada, Santa Lucia, and St.
Vincent. Guadaloupe had been taken in 1759,
and Dominica in June, 1761.</p>

<p>Up to this time the contest on the seas had
been between Great Britain and France only;
but on March 5th a frigate reached Rodney
with instructions, then already nine weeks old,
to begin hostilities against Spain, whose clearly
inimical purpose had induced the British Government
to anticipate her action, by declaring
war. The same day another vessel came in with
like orders from the admiral at Gibraltar, while
a third from before Brest brought word that a
French squadron of seven ships-of-the-line, with
frigates and two thousand troops, had escaped
from that port at the end of the year. With
these circumstances before him Rodney's conduct
was like himself; prompt and officer-like.
Lookout ships were stationed along the length
of the Caribbees, to windward, to bring timely
intelligence of the approach of the enemy's
squadron; and as its first destination was probably
Martinique, the fall of which was not yet
known in Europe, he concentrated his fleet
there, calling in outlying detachments.</p>

<p>So far there was nothing in his course markedly
different from that of any capable officer,
dealing with well ascertained conditions within
the limits of his own command. Occasion soon
arose, however, to require more exceptional ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>tion,
and thus to illustrate at once the breadth of
view, and the readiness to assume responsibility,
which already raised Rodney conspicuously above
the average level. On the 9th of March two
lookout vessels came in with news that they had
sighted a fleet, corresponding in numbers to the
Brest division, fifteen miles to windward of Martinique
and standing to the southward; the trade
wind making it generally expedient to round the
south point of the island in order to reach the
principal port on the west side,&mdash;Fort Royal.
The British squadron at once weighed anchor in
pursuit; but the enemy, having ascertained that
the surrender was accomplished, had turned back
north, and were soon after reported from Guadaloupe
as having passed there, standing to the
westward.</p>

<p>Rodney at once inferred that they must be
gone to Santo Domingo. To follow with the
object of intercepting them was hopeless, in view
of the start they had; but the direction taken
threatened Jamaica, the exposed condition of
which, owing to inadequate force, had been communicated
to him by the military and naval
authorities there. His measures to meet the
case were thorough and deliberate, as well as
rapid; no time was lost either by hesitancy or
delay, nor by the yet more facile error of too
precipitate movement. Orders for concentration
were already out, but the point on which to effect
it was shifted to Antigua, where, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
inferior in natural resources to Martinique, the
established British naval station with its accumulated
equipment was fixed; and the work of
provisioning and watering, so as to permit long
continuance at sea unhampered by necessity of
replenishing, there went on apace. It was the
admiral's intention to leave his own command to
look out for itself, while he took away the mass
of his fleet to protect national interests elsewhere
threatened.</p>

<p>Such a decision may seem superficially a commonplace
matter of course; that it was much
more is a commonplace historical certainty. The
merit of Rodney's action appears not only in the
details of execution, but in its being undertaken
at all; and in this case, as in a later instance in
his career, his resolution received the concrete
emphasis that a sharp and immediate contrast
best affords. Prior to the enemy's arrival he had
laid the conditions before his colleague in service,
General Moncton, commanding the forces on
shore, and asked a reinforcement of troops for
destitute Jamaica, if necessity arose. The result
is best told in his own words; for they convey,
simply and without egotistic enlargement, that
settled personal characteristic, the want of which
Jervis and Nelson in their day noted in many,
and which Rodney markedly possessed. This
was the capacity, which Sandwich eighteen years
later styled "taking the great line of considering
the King's whole dominions under your care;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
an attribute far from common, as Moncton's
reply showed. "I acquainted him that I should
certainly assist them with all the naval force that
could possibly be spared from the immediate protection
of His Majesty's Caribbee islands. I have
again solicited the General for a body of troops,
since the enemy left these seas, and must do him
the justice to say, that he seems much concerned
at the present distress of Jamaica, but does not
think himself sufficiently <i>authorized</i> to detach a
body of troops without orders from England. I
flatter myself their Lordships will not be displeased
with me if I take the liberty to construe
my instructions in such a manner as to think
myself <i>authorized and obliged</i> to succor any of
His Majesty's colonies that may be in danger;
and shall, therefore, without a moment's loss of
time, hasten to the succor of Jamaica, with ten
sail-of-the-line, three frigates and three bombs."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>It was not because, in so doing this, the obligation
was absolute, and the authority indisputable,
that Rodney's course was professionally meritorious.
In such case his action would have risen
little above that obedience to orders, in which, as
Nelson said, the generality find "all perfection."
The risk was real, not only to his station, but
to the possible plans of his superiors at home;
the authority was his own only, read by himself
into his orders&mdash;at most their spirit, not their
letter. Consequently, he took grave chance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>the penalty&mdash;loss of reputation, if not positive
punishment,&mdash;which, as military experience
shows, almost invariably follows independent
action, unless results are kind enough to justify
it. It is, however, only the positive characters
capable of rising to such measures that achieve
reputations enduring beyond their own day. The
incident needs to be coupled with Sandwich's
compliment just quoted, as well as with the one
paid him when on the Newfoundland command.
Taken together, they avouch a personality that
needs only opportunity to insure itself lasting
fame.</p>

<p>As it happened, Rodney not only took the responsibility
of stripping his own station to the
verge of bareness in favor of the general interest,
but in so doing he came very near traversing,
unwittingly, the plans of the general government
by his local action, laudable and proper as that
certainly was. He was, however, professionally
lucky to a proverb, and escaped this mischance
by a hair's breadth. The purposed detachment
had already started for Jamaica, and he was accompanying
it in person, when there joined him
on March 25th, off the island of St. Kitt's, not
far from Antigua, a frigate bearing Admiralty
despatches of February 5th. These required him
to desist from any enterprises he might have in
hand, in order to give his undivided attention to
the local preparations for an expedition, as yet
secret, which was shortly to arrive on his station,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
under the command of Admiral Pocock, with
ultimate destination against Havana.</p>

<p>To be thus arrested at the very outset of a
movement from which he naturally expected distinction
was a bitter disappointment to Rodney.
Several years later, in 1771, he wrote to Sandwich,
who was not the First Lord when Pocock
was sent out, "I had the misfortune of being superseded
in the command of a successful fleet,
entrusted to my care in the West Indies, at the
very time I had sailed on another expedition
against the enemy's squadron at Santo Domingo,
and was thereby deprived of pursuing those conquests
which so honorably attended upon another,
and which secured him such great emoluments,"&mdash;for
Havana proved a wealthy prize. His
steps, however, upon this unexpected reversal of
his plans, were again characterized by an immediateness,
most honorable to his professional character,
which showed how thoroughly familiar he
was with the whole subject and its possible contingencies,
and the consequent readiness of his
mind to meet each occasion as it arose; marks,
all, of the thoroughly equipped general officer.
The order as to his personal movements being
not discretional, was of course absolutely accepted;
but his other measures were apparently
his own, and were instantaneous. A vessel was
at once sent off to Barbados to notify Admiral
Pocock that the best place in the West Indies for
his rendezvous was Fort Royal Bay, in the newly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
acquired Martinique. The ten sail-of-the-line, accompanied
by two large transports from St. Kitt's,
were then sent on to Jamaica to move troops
from there to join Pocock; the command of the
detachment being now entrusted to Sir James
Douglas, who received the further instruction
to send back his fastest frigate, with all the
intelligence he could gather, directing her to
keep in the track Pocock would follow, in order
to meet him betimes. The frigate thus sent,
having first made a running survey of the unfrequented
passage north of Cuba, by which the
expedition was to proceed, joined Pocock, and, by
the latter's report, acted as pilot for the fleet.
"Having taken sketches of the land and cayos
on both sides, Captain Elphinstone kept ahead
of the fleet, and led us through very well." This
service is claimed to the credit of Rodney's foresight
by his biographer. This may very well be,
though more particular inquiry and demonstration
by his letters would be necessary to establish
specific orders beyond the general instructions
given by him. It is, however, safe to say that
such particularity and minuteness of detail would
be entirely in keeping with the tenor of his course
at this period. His correspondence bears the
stamp of a mind comprehensive as well as exact;
grasping all matters with breadth of view in their
mutual relations, yet with the details at his fingers'
ends. The certainty of his touch is as obvious as
the activity of his thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>In accordance with the spirit of his instructions,
Rodney went in person to Martinique, the spot
named by him as best for the rendezvous, there
to superintend the preparations; to sow the seed
for a harvest in which he was to have no share.
Incidental mention reveals that the sending of
the ships-of-the-line with Douglas had reduced
him to three for his own command; and also that
Moncton, having now superior authority to do so,
found himself able to spare troops for Jamaica,
which were afloat in transports by the time
Pocock came. In the same letter the admiral
frankly admits his anxiety for his station, under
the circumstances of the big detachment he had
made; a significant avowal, which enhances the
merit of his spontaneous action by all the credit
due to one who endures a well-weighed danger
for an adequate end.</p>

<p>The despatch of Pocock's expedition, which resulted
in the fall of Havana, August 13, 1762,
practically terminated Rodney's active service in
the Seven Years War. In a career marked by
unusual professional good fortune in many ways,
the one singular mischance was that he reached
a foremost position too late in life. When he
returned to England in August, 1763, he was in
his full prime, and his conduct of affairs entrusted
to him had given clear assurance of capacity for
great things. The same evidence is to be found
in his letters, which, as studies of official character
and competency, repay a close perusal. But now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
fifteen years of peace were to elapse before a
maritime war again broke out, and the fifteen
years between forty-five and sixty tell sorely
upon the physical stamina which need to underlie
the mental and moral forces of a great commander.
St. Vincent himself staggered under
the load, and Rodney was not a St. Vincent in
the stern self-discipline that had braced the
latter for old age. He had not borne the yoke in
his youth, and from this time forward he fought
a losing fight with money troubles, which his
self-controlled contemporary, after one bitter experience,
had shaken off his shoulders forever.</p>

<p>The externals of Rodney's career during the
period now in question are sufficiently known;
of his strictly private life we are left largely to
infer from indications, not wholly happy. He
returned to England a Vice-Admiral of the Blue,
and had advanced by the successive grades of
that rank to Vice-Admiral of the Red, when, in
January, 1771, he was appointed Commander-in-chief
at Jamaica. At this time he had been for
five years Governor of Greenwich Hospital, and
he took it hard that he was not allowed to retain
the appointment in connection with his new command,
alleging precedents for such a favor; the
latest of which, however, was then twenty-five
years old. The application was denied by Sandwich.
From the earnest tone in which it was
couched, as well as the comparatively weak
grounds upon which Rodney bases his claims<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
to such a recognition, it can scarcely be doubted
that pecuniary embarrassment as well as mortification
entered into his sense of disappointment. It
is the first recorded of a series of jars between
the two, in which, although the external forms of
courtesy were diligently observed, an underlying
estrangement is evident.</p>

<p>The Jamaica Station at that day required, in
an even greater degree than Newfoundland before
the conquest of Canada, a high order of
political tact and circumspection on the part of
the naval commander-in-chief. The island lies in
the centre of what was then a vast semi-circular
sweep of Spanish colonies&mdash;Porto Rico, Santo
Domingo, Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the
mainland of South America from the Isthmus to
the Orinoco. Over this subject empire the mother
country maintained commercial regulations of
the most medi&aelig;val and exclusive type; outraging
impartially the British spirit of commercial
enterprise, and the daily needs of her own colonists,
by the restrictions placed upon intercourse
between these and foreigners. Smuggling on a
large scale, consecrated in the practice of both
parties by a century of tradition, was met by a
coast-guard system, employing numerous small
vessels called guarda-costas, which girt the Spanish
coasts, but, being powerless to repress effectually
over so extensive a shore line, served rather
to increase causes of vexation. The British government,
on the other hand, not satisfied to leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the illicit trade on which Jamaica throve to take
care of itself, sought to increase the scope of
transactions by the institution of three free ports
on the island,&mdash;free in the sense of being open as
depots, not for the entrance of goods, but where
they could be freely brought, and transshipped
to other parts of the world by vessels of all nations;
broker ports, in short, for the facilitation
of general external trade.</p>

<p>To this open and ingenuous bid for fuller advantage
by Spanish resort, Spain replied by
doubling her custom-house forces and introducing
renewed stringency into her commercial
orders. The two nations, with France in Hayti
for a third, stood on ceaseless guard one against
the other; all imbued with the spirit of exclusive
trade, and differing only in the method of application,
according to their respective day-to-day
views of policy. The British by the free-port
system, instituted in their central geographical
position, hoped to make the profits of the middleman.
Rodney reported that the effect had been
notably to discourage the direct Spanish intercourse,
and to destroy carriage by British colonial
vessels in favor of those of France, which now
flocked to Jamaica, smuggled goods into the
island, and apparently cut under their rivals by
the greater benevolence shown them in Spanish
ports. "Commerce by British bottoms has totally
ceased." Herewith, he added, disappeared
the opportunities of British seamen to become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
familiar with the Spanish and French waters,
while their rivals were invited to frequent those
of Jamaica; so that in case of war&mdash;which in
those days was periodical&mdash;the advantage of
pilotage would be heavily on the side of Great
Britain's enemies. He also stated that the diminution
of employment to British merchant
vessels had greatly impaired his means of obtaining
information from within Spanish ports; for
British ships of war were never allowed inside
them, even when sent with a message from him.
The French permitted them indeed to enter, but
surrounded them throughout their visits with
flattering attentions which wholly prevented the
making of observations.</p>

<p>Under these conditions of mutual jealousy between
the governments and officials, with the
subjects on either side straining continually at
the leashes which withheld them from traffic mutually
beneficial, causes of offence were quick to
arise. Rodney, like Sandwich, was a pronounced
Tory, in full sympathy with traditional British
policy, as well as an officer naturally of haughty
temper and sharing all the prepossessions of his
service; but he found himself almost at once involved
in a difference with his superiors in his
political party, which throws a good deal of side
light on personal as well as political relations.
The British man-of-war schooner <i>Hawke</i> was
overhauled off the Venezuelan coast by two
Spanish guarda-costas and compelled to enter the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
harbor of Cartagena, under alleged orders from
the Governor of the colony. After a brief detention,
she was let go with the admonition that, if
any British ships of war were found again within
twelve leagues of the coast, they would be taken
and their crews imprisoned.</p>

<p>Rodney's course was unimpeachable, as far as
appears. He wrote a civil letter to the Governor,
and sent it by a ship of war, the captain of which
was directed to deliver it in person. He was
confident, he wrote, that the Governor would disavow
the action by calling to strict account the
officers concerned, and would also confirm his
own belief that it was impossible such a menace
could have proceeded from any adequate authority.
A sufficient intimation of what would follow
an attempt to carry out the threat was conveyed
by the words: "The British officer who has dishonoured
his King's colours by a tame submission
to this insult has been already dismissed the
service."</p>

<p>It is difficult to see what less could have been
done; but the British government was at the
moment extremely reluctant to war, and sensitive
to any step that seemed to make towards it.
Spain was thought to be seeking a quarrel. She
had entered the Seven Years War so near its
termination as not to feel exhaustive effects; and
the capture of Havana and Manila, with the pecuniary
losses involved, had left her merely embittered
by humiliation, prone rather to renew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
hostilities than to profit by experience. At the
same time the foreign policy of Great Britain was
enfeebled by a succession of short ministries, and
by internal commotions; while the discontent of
the American continental colonies over the
Stamp Act emphasized the weakness of her general
position. Barely a year before the <i>Hawke</i>
incident the insult by Spain at the Falkland
Islands had brought the two nations to the verge
of rupture, which was believed to have been
averted only by the refusal of Louis XV., then
advanced in years, to support the Spanish Bourbons
at the cost of another war.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Rodney's report of
the occurrences at Cartagena filled the ministry
with apprehensions, and brought him from Sandwich
an expression of dissatisfaction little removed
from a reprimand. The communication is remarkable
rather for what it intimates, and from the inferences
naturally deducible, than for its direct
utterances. "I cannot help cautioning you, as a
friend, to be upon your guard, to avoid by every
justifiable means the drawing this country into a
war, which, if it comes on too speedily, I fear we
shall have cause to lament." The warning is renewed
in a later part of the letter, but in itself
has little significance compared with other hints,
rather personal than official. "I cannot conceal
from you, that many people have industriously
spread stories here, that, among the foreign ministers
and others, you have expressed your wishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
for a Spanish war." Such expressions&mdash;if used&mdash;were
asserted of the time succeeding his appointment
to Jamaica, and near his departure for
it; for Sandwich adds, "This sort of declaration
is too little founded on your instructions, and too
indiscreet, to allow me to give them the least
credit." It is clear, however, that he thought
them not improbable,&mdash;a Spanish war was popular
with seamen for the prize-money it brought,
and Rodney was poor,&mdash;for he adds, "I shall discredit
the idea till I have received your answer
to this letter." He concludes with a warning, not
to be misunderstood, that a war, so far from helping
Rodney, would probably cause his supersession.
"I will add one word more: Upon a declaration
of war larger squadrons must be sent out,
and, very probably, senior officers to most of our
stations in foreign parts." In face of an intimation
thus thinly veiled, one scarcely needs to be
told what was being said round the table of the
Cabinet.</p>

<p>That Rodney would have welcomed war for
reasons personal as well as professional, for
money and for glory, can readily be believed; but
his measures in this case give no ground for such
an innuendo as Sandwich conveyed. Therefore,
after making full allowance for the panic of ministers
ready to fear the worst, and to throw blame on
anybody, it is the more significant that he should
have been suspected of an unworthy personal
motive underlying a worthy official act. It is an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
indication of reputation already compromised by
damaging association with pecuniary embarrassments;
an evidence of latent distrust easily
quickened into active suspicion. An officer of
his rank and service, so far from home, and with
the precedents of his day, could scarcely be faulted
for what he had done to uphold the honor of the
country; and his manner of doing it was dignified
and self-restrained, as well as forcible. There
was no violence like that of Hawke at Gibraltar,
less than twenty years before, which that admiral
had boldly vindicated to Pitt himself; but there
were no weak joints in Hawke's armor. In the
particular instance, time and cooler judgment set
Rodney right in men's opinion; but subsequent
events showed that his general reputation did
not recover, either then, or through his Jamaica
career.</p>

<p>After immediate apprehension had subsided,
Rodney's action was justified by the government.
Sandwich wrote him, a little later, that no commander-in-chief
stood upon a better footing, and
assured him that his private interests were safe
in his hands. Sandwich, however, was an extremely
practical politician, who had much personal
use for his own patronage; and Rodney's
necessities were great. Fulfilment therefore fell
far short of promise. Employment was necessary
to the admiral, and his hopes fixed upon a
colonial governorship when his present appointment
should expire; Jamaica being his first choice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Sandwich renewed assurances, but advised a
personal application also to the Prime Minister
and other Cabinet officers. New York was mentioned,
but nothing came of it all. After three
years Rodney was superseded, with permission
to remain in the island instead of returning to
England. This he declined. "I cannot bear to
think of remaining here in a private station, after
commanding in chief with the approbation of the
whole island." How far this approbation was
universal, or unqualified, is perhaps doubtful; but
the letters quoted by his biographer from his correspondence
bear continuous evidence, in this
peace employment, of the activity and perspicacity
of mind characteristic of his more strictly
military proceedings.</p>

<p>In September, 1774, Rodney landed again in
England, a disappointed man and in embarrassed
circumstances. Professional occupation
was almost hopeless, for in peace times there
were few positions for an officer of his rank;
and, although recognized for able, he had not
then the distinction by which he is known to us.
It is also evident, from subsequent events, that he
just now lacked the influence necessary to obtain
a preference over rivals in quest of employment.
Under the circumstances, his debts determined
his action, and to escape harassments he before
long passed over into France and settled in
Paris. In that capital, as in London, he mixed
with the best society; and there, as before, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
mode of life among his associates led him beyond
his means and involved him in further distresses.
Consequently, when war between France and
Great Britain became imminent, in 1778, the
vigilance of his creditors prevented his going
home in person to offer his services. In February
of that year, however, he made formal
application to the Admiralty to be sent at a
moment's warning on any enterprise. To this
Sandwich, who was still First Lord, despite his
previous assurances of friendship, paid no attention
beyond the formal customary acknowledgment
given to all such letters when they came
from officers of Rodney's standing. No indication
was shown of intention, or even of wish,
to employ him.</p>

<p>Rodney was therefore compelled to look on
idly while others, of well-earned reputation indeed
but as yet of less experience than himself
in high command, were preferred before him.
Howe had already been sent to North America
in 1776, on a mission at once diplomatic and military;
and there he still was when war began.
As it became imminent, Keppel was appointed
to the Channel Fleet, and Byron to the North
American command, from which Howe had
asked to be relieved. All these were junior to
Rodney; and, as though to emphasize the neglect
of him, rear-admirals were sent to the two West
India stations, Jamaica and the Leeward Islands,
which he had formerly commanded, and to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
it would seem, from one of his letters, that he
desired to return. He had, too, now reached the
rank, the want of which had formed the burden
of Sandwich's warning that he was in danger of
supersession at Jamaica; for in a general flag
promotion in January, 1778, he had become
Admiral of the White Squadron, than which no
higher then obtained, commissions as Admirals
of the Red not being issued. For this persistent
ignoring of an officer of his unquestionable ability
there were necessarily reasons more controlling
than appears on the surface; for the naval conditions
and the national emergency called for
men of demonstrated high capacity. Such Rodney
was professionally; and although his age&mdash;he
was now in his sixtieth year&mdash;was against
him, this consideration did not in those days
weigh; nor should it, unless accompanied by
probable indication of powers sapped.</p>

<p>The conclusion is inevitable that the objection
lay in personal record as bearing upon military
efficiency. The Administration, responsible for
results, knew Rodney's capacity, though its full
extent was yet to be revealed; the question in
their minds clearly must have been, "Can we depend
upon its exertion, full, sustained, and disinterested?"
Sandwich, despite the coldness with
which he had received Rodney's application,&mdash;going
so far as to refuse to support it actively,&mdash;was
apparently in a minority among his colleagues
in believing that they could. He declared in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
House of Lords that, "When it was first proposed
in the Council to employ Sir George, I,
who knew him from a very young man, declared
that Rodney <i>once afloat</i> would do his duty."
Naval officers will recognize a familiar ring in
these words, and will recall instances where high
professional ability has been betrayed by personal
foible. Nor does Sandwich stand alone in offering
a clue to the hesitation of the Government.
Rodney's biographer and son-in-law quotes without
reprobation the account of Mr. Richard Cumberland,
who professed to have interested himself
warmly for Rodney's employment and to have
secured the support of the Secretary for War,
Lord George Germaine. "The West India merchants
had been alarmed, and clamoured against
the appointment so generally and so decidedly as
to occasion no small uneasiness in my friend and
patron, Lord George, and drew from him something
that resembled a remonstrance for the risk
I had exposed him to. But in the brilliancy of
the capture of Langara's squadron all was done
away, and past alarms were only recollected to
contrast the joy which this success diffused."
The opposition of the commercial class in the
West Indies might arise from an officer's over-faithfulness
to duty, as Nelson found to his cost;
but it seems clear that in this case distrust rested
upon personal observation, which raised doubts as
to the singlemindedness of Rodney's administration
of a command. Of the particulars of obser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>vation
or experience from which the feeling
sprang, we have no information; but St. Eustatius
was destined to show that apprehension
was not wholly unfounded.</p>

<p>A summons to active employment would at
once have silenced Rodney's creditors by the assurance
of increase of means, both through regular
income and probable prize-money; Admiralty
neglect left him in fetters. Lady Rodney returned
to England to negotiate the means for
his liberation; but the matter dragged, and in
the end he owed his release to the friendly intervention
of a French nobleman, the Mar&eacute;chal
Biron, who volunteered in warm terms to make
him an advance to the amount of &pound;2,000. This
chivalrous offer was for some time declined; but
finally conditions became so threatening, and
his position so intolerable, that he accepted a
loan of about a thousand louis. "Nothing but
a total inattention to the distressed state I was
in," he wrote to his wife, "could have prevailed
upon me to have availed myself of his voluntary
proposal; but not having had, for a month past,
a letter from any person but Mr. Hotham and
yourself, and my passport being expired, it was
impossible for me to remain in this city at the
risk of being sued by my creditors, who grew so
clamorous it was impossible to bear it; and had
they not been overawed by the Lieutenant of police,
would have carried their prosecutions to the
greatest length. Their demands were all satis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>fied
this day,"&mdash;May 6th, 1778. Friends in
England enabled him to repay Biron immediately
after his return.</p>

<p>This benevolent interference on behalf of a national
enemy, although in its spirit quite characteristic,
at once of the country and of the class to
which the individual extending it belonged, has
retained a certain unique flavor of its own among
military anecdotes; due undoubtedly to the distinction
subsequently acquired by Rodney at the
expense of the people to which his liberator belonged,
rather than to anything exceptional in
its nature. As it is, it has acquired a clear pre-eminence
among the recorded courtesies of warfare.
It is pleasant to add that Great Britain had
the opportunity in after times to requite Biron's
daughters an act from which she had so greatly
benefited. They having sought refuge, though
with loss of fortune, from the early excesses of
the French Revolution, received for some time
pensions from the British Government.</p>

<p>Rodney came back to England feeling anything
but cordial towards Sandwich, whose decided
support he had found wanting throughout
a very critical period of his career. More than
any one else the First Lord had had both the opportunity
and the insight to see his professional
value. Tory though Rodney was, he hoped that
"Lord Chatham (Pitt) would be minister, and
another First Lord of the Admiralty be appointed."
"We hear of a change of Administra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>tion.
I hope it is true, and that I may have a
chance of being employed, should another be at
the Admiralty." "The refusal of Lord Sandwich
does not surprise me. He cannot say but I have
offered my services, and some friend will let the
King know I have so done." Apparently he
was to be ignored as well as overlooked.</p>

<p>Circumstances, however, soon compelled his
employment. Sandwich was an able man, but
his personal character inspired mistrust. Not
only was he controlled by political considerations
in administration; he was suspected of corruptly
using the Navy for party advantage. Whatever
might be thought of Byng's conduct, his execution,
but twenty years before, was commonly
ascribed to political exigency, making him a vicarious
sacrifice to cover the neglects of a Government.
As in Byng's case, the material of the
service was believed to be now inadequate to
the emergency come upon it; and it was known
to have deteriorated gravely during the seven
years of Sandwich's tenure of office. He was a
Tory, as were his colleagues of the Cabinet; the
leaders of the Navy in professional estimation,
Hawke and Keppel, with other distinguished officers,
were pronounced Whigs, whom it was
thought the Administration would be willing to
destroy. Keppel evidently feared an intention to
ruin him by the command of the Channel Fleet,
and the public discussion of the Courts-Martial
which followed his indecisive action with D'Or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>villiers,
in July, 1778, assumed a decided and
rancorous party tone. His accuser then was his
third-in-command, Vice-Admiral Palliser, who
had left his place on the Admiralty Board to
take this position in the fleet; and popular outcry
charged him with having betrayed his chief
in the battle. So far was professional feeling
moved that twelve prominent admirals,&mdash;not all
of whom were Whigs,&mdash;with Hawke at their
head, presented to the King a memorial, deprecating
"particularly the mischief and scandal of permitting
men, <i>who are at once in high office and
subordinate military command</i>, previous to their
making recriminating accusations against their
commander-in-chief, to attempt to corrupt the public
judgment by the publication of libels on their
officers in a common newspaper, thereby exciting
mutiny in your Majesty's Navy," etc. The words
italicized show that this was aimed at Palliser;
and at Sandwich, who inferentially had "permitted"
his action, and ultimately rewarded him
with the Governorship of Greenwich Hospital.</p>

<p>In this demoralized condition of professional
sentiment the Admiralty could no longer command
the services of the best men. Howe came
home in disgust from America. Keppel threw
up the command of the Channel Fleet, and Barrington
subsequently refused it on the expressed
ground of self-distrust, underlying which was
real distrust of the ministry. He would serve
as second, but not as first. Byron, after reliev<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>ing
Howe in New York, went to the West
Indies, there made a failure, and so came home
in the summer of 1779. The Channel squadron
fell into the hands of men respectable, indeed,
but in no way eminent, and advanced in years,
whose tenures of office were comparatively short.
Hardy was sixty-three, Geary seventy; and on
both Hawke, who was friendly to them, passed
the comment that they were "too easy." The
first had allowed "the discipline of the fleet to
come to nothing," and he feared the same for
the other. Not until the fall of the ministry,
consequent upon Cornwallis's surrender, was the
post filled by a distinguished name, when Howe
took the command in 1782.</p>

<p>The Administration was thus forced back upon
Rodney; fortunately for itself, for, as far as history
has since revealed, there was no other man
then in the service, and of suitable rank, exactly
fitted to do the work he did. Samuel Hood
alone, then an unproved captain, and practically
in voluntary retirement, could have equalled and
surpassed him. Howe, like Rodney, was an accomplished
tactician, and in conception far in
advance of the standards of the day. In his
place he did admirable service, which has been
too little appreciated, and he was fortunate in
that the work which fell to him, at the first, and
again at the last of this war, was peculiarly suited
to his professional characteristics; but he was
not interchangeable with Rodney. In the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
there was a briskness of temper, a vivacity, very
distinguishable from Howe's solidity of persistence;
and he was in no sense one to permit "discipline
to come to nought," the direction in which
Howe's easy though reserved disposition tended.
The West Indies were to be the great scene of
battles, and, while the tactical ideas of the two
appear to have been essentially alike, in the common
recognition of combination as imperative to
success, the severity of Rodney was needed to jerk
the West India fleet sharply out of sleepy tradition;
to compel promptness of manoeuvre and intelligent
attention to the underlying ideas which
signals communicate. Flexibility of movement,
earnestness and rapidity of attack, mutual support
by the essential coherence of the battle order
without too formal precision,&mdash;these were the
qualities which Rodney was to illustrate in practice,
and to enforce by personal impression upon
his officers. The official staff of the fleet had to
pass under the rod of the schoolmaster, to receive
new ideas, and to learn novel principles of obedience,&mdash;to
a living chief, not to a dead letter
crusted over by an unintelligent tradition. Not
till this step had been made, till discipline had
full hold of men's affections and understanding,
was there room for the glorious liberty of action
which Nelson extended to his officers; preaching
it in word, and practising it in act. Hawke re-begat
the British Navy in the spirit he imparted
to it; Rodney, first of several, trained its ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>proaching
maturity in habits which, once acquired,
stand by men as principles; Nelson
reaped the fulness of the harvest.</p>

<p>On October 1, 1779, Rodney was again appointed
to the command of the Leeward Islands
Station. The year had been one of maritime misfortune
and discouragement. The French declaration
of war in 1778 had been followed by that
of Spain in June, 1779; and a huge allied fleet&mdash;sixty-six
ships-of-the-line, to which the British
could oppose only thirty-five&mdash;had that summer
entered and dominated the English Channel.
Nothing was effected by it, true; but the impression
produced was profound. In the West
Indies Grenada had been lost, and Byron badly
worsted in an attempt to relieve it. On assuming
his command, Rodney could not but feel that
he had more to do than to establish a reputation;
he had a reputation to redeem, and that under a
burden of national depression which doubly endangered
the reputation of every officer in responsible
position. He must have known that,
however undeservedly, he had not the full confidence
of the government, although party and
personal ties would naturally have predisposed
it in his favor. He therefore entered upon his
career under the necessity to do and to dare
greatly; he had not a strong hand, and needed
the more to play a game not only strong, but to
some extent adventurous.</p>

<p>To the radical difference between his personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
standing at this opening of his command, and
that which he had at its close, in 1782, may reasonably
be attributed the clear difference in his
action at the two periods. The first was audacious
and brilliant, exhibiting qualities of which
he was capable on occasion, but which did not
form the groundwork of his professional character.
The display was therefore exceptional, elicited by
exceptional personal emergency. It was vitally
necessary at the outset, if opportunity offered, to
vindicate his selection by the government; to
strike the imagination of the country, and obtain
a hold upon its confidence which could not
easily be shaken. This prestige once established,
he could safely rest upon it to bear him through
doubtful periods of suspense and protracted issues.
It would have been well had he felt the same
spur after his great battle in 1782. A necessity
like this doubtless lies upon every opening career,
and comparatively few there be that rise to it;
but there is an evident distinction to be drawn
between one in the early prime of life, who may
afford to wait, who has at least no errors to atone,
and him who is about to make his last cast,
when upon the turning of a die depends a fair
opportunity to show what is in him. Rodney
was near sixty-one, when he took up the command
which has given him his well earned place
in history.</p>

<p>He experienced at once indications of the attitude
towards him; and in two directions, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the Admiralty and from his subordinates. A
month before he was ready, Sandwich urges him,
with evident impatience, to get off. "For God's
sake, go to sea without delay. You cannot conceive
of what importance it is to yourself, to me,
and to the public" (this very order of importance
is suggestive), "that you should not lose this fair
wind; if you do, I shall not only hear of it in
Parliament, but in places to which I pay more
attention.... I must once more repeat to you
that any delay in your sailing will have the most
disagreeable consequences." On the other hand,
he had to complain not only of inattention on
the part of the dockyard officials, but of want of
zeal and activity in the officers of the fleet, many
of whom behaved with a disrespect and want of
cordiality which are too often the precursor of
worse faults. Rodney was not the man to put up
with such treatment. That it was offered, and
that he for the moment bore with it, are both
significant; and are to be remembered in connection
with the fast approaching future.</p>

<p>Gibraltar was then at the beginning of the
three years siege, and his intended departure was
utilized to give him command of the first of the
three great expeditions for its relief, which were
among the characteristic operations of this war.
He sailed from Plymouth on the 29th of December,
1779, having under him twenty-two sail-of-the-line,
of which only four were to continue with
him to the West Indies. With this great fleet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and its attendant frigates, went also a huge collection
of storeships, victuallers, ordnance vessels,
troop ships, and merchantmen; the last comprising
the "trade" for Portugal and the West Indies,
as the other classes carried the reinforcements for
the Rock.</p>

<p>On January 7th, the West India trade parted
company off Cape Finisterre, and the next day
began the wonderful good fortune for which
Rodney's last command was distinguished. It
is no disparagement to his merit to say that in
this he was, to use Ball's phrase about Nelson,
"a heaven-born admiral." A Spanish convoy of
twenty-two sail, seven of which were ships of
war, the rest laden with supplies for Cadiz, were
sighted at daylight of the 8th, and all taken; not
one escaped. Twelve loaded with provisions
were turned into the British convoy, and went on
with it to feed the Gibraltar garrison. A prince
of the blood-royal, afterwards King William IV.,
was with the fleet as a midshipman. One of the
prizes being a line-of-battle ship, Rodney had an
opportunity to show appositely his courtliness of
breeding. "I have named her the <i>Prince William</i>,
in respect to His Royal Highness, in whose
presence <i>she had the honor to be taken</i>."</p>

<p>Repeated intelligence had reached the admiral
that a Spanish division was cruising off Cape St.
Vincent. Therefore, when it was sighted at 1
P.M. of January 16th, a week after the capture of
the convoy, he was prepared for the event. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
brief attempt to form line was quickly succeeded
by the signal for a general chase, the ships to engage
to leeward as they came up with the enemy,
who, by taking flight to the southeast, showed
the intention to escape into Cadiz. The wind
was blowing strong from the westward, giving a
lee shore and shoals to the British fleet in the
approaching long hours of a wintry night; but
opportunity was winging by, with which neither
Rodney nor the Navy could afford to trifle. He
was already laid up with an attack of the gout
that continued to harass him throughout this
command, and the decision to continue the chase
was only reached after a discussion between him
and his captain, the mention of which is transmitted
by Sir Gilbert Blane, the surgeon of the
ship, who was present professionally. The merit
of the resolution must remain with the man who
bore the responsibility of the event; but that he
reached it at such a moment only after consultation
with another, to whom current gossip attributed
the chief desert, must be coupled with
the plausible claim afterwards advanced for Sir
Charles Douglas, that he suggested the breaking
of the enemy's line on April 12th. Taken together,
they indicate at least a common contemporary
professional estimate of Rodney's temperament.
No such anecdote is transmitted of
Hawke. The battle of Cape St. Vincent, therefore,
is not that most characteristic of Rodney's
genius. Judged by his career at large, it is ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>ceptional;
yet of all his actions it is the one in
which merit and success most conspicuously met.
Nor does it at all detract from his credit that the
enemy was much inferior in numbers; eleven to
twenty-one. As in Hawke's pursuit of Conflans,
with which this engagement is worthy to be
classed, what was that night dared, rightly and
brilliantly dared, was the dangers of the deep,
not of the foe. The prey was seized out of the
jaws of disaster.</p>

<p>The results were commensurate to the risk.
The action, which began at 4 P.M., lasted till two
the following morning, the weather becoming
tempestuous with a great sea, so that it was
difficult to take possession of the captured vessels.
Many of the heavy British ships continued
also in danger during the 17th, and had to
carry a press of sail to clear the shoals, on which
two of their prizes were actually wrecked. One
Spanish ship-of-the-line was blown up and six
struck, among them the flag-ship of Admiral Langara,
who was taken into Gibraltar. Only four
escaped.</p>

<p>Two such strokes of mingled good fortune and
good management, within ten days, formed a rare
concurrence, and the aggregate results were as
exceptional as the combination of events. Sandwich
congratulated Rodney that he had already
"taken more line-of-battle ships than had been
captured in any one action in either of the two
last preceding wars." Militarily regarded, it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
a further high element of praise, for the enemy's
detachment, though in itself inferior, was part of
a much superior force; twenty-four allied ships-of-the-line
besides it being at the moment in
Cadiz Bay. It is the essence of military art
thus to overwhelm in detail. A technical circumstance
like this was doubtless overlooked in
the general satisfaction with the event, the most
evident feature in which was the relief of the
Government, who just then stood badly in need
of credit. "The ministerial people feel it very
sensibly," Lady Rodney wrote him. "It is a
lucky stroke for them at this juncture." Salutes
were fired, and the city illuminated; the press
teemed with poetical effusion. Sandwich, somewhat
impudently when the past is considered, but
not uncharacteristically regarded as an officeholder,
took to himself a large slice of the credit.
"The worst of my enemies now allow that I
have pitched upon a man who knows his duty,
and is a brave, honest, and able officer.... I
have obtained you the thanks of both houses
of Parliament." The letter does not end without
a further caution against indiscreet talking
about the condition of his ships. It all comes
back on the Government, he laments. What
Rodney may have said to others may be uncertain;
to his wife, soon after reaching his station,
he wrote, "What are the ministers about? Are
they determined to undo their country? Is it
fair that the British fleet should be so inferior to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the French, and that the British officers and men
are always to be exposed to superior numbers?
What right had the administration to expect anything
but defeat?" Then he passes on to remark
himself, what has been alluded to above, the
change in his personal position effected by his
successes. "Thank God, I now fear no frowns
of ministers, and hope never again to stand in
need of their assistance. I know them well. All
are alike, and no dependence is to be placed on
their promises." It is to be feared his sense of
obligation to Sandwich did not coincide with
the latter's estimate.</p>

<p>In his official report Rodney gave much credit
to his officers for the St. Vincent affair. "The
gallant behaviour of the admirals, captains, officers
and men, I had the honour to command,
was conspicuous; they seemed animated with the
same spirit, and were eager to exert themselves
with the utmost zeal." Here also, however, he
was biding his time for obvious reasons; for to
his wife he writes, "I have done them all like
honour, but it is because I would not have the
world believe that there were officers slack in their
duty. Without a thorough change in naval affairs,
the discipline of our navy will be lost. I could
say much, but will not. You will hear of it from
<i>themselves</i>;" that is, probably, by their mutual
recriminations. Such indulgent envelopment of
good and bad alike in a common mantle of commendation
is far from unexampled; but it rarely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
fails to return to plague its authors, as has been
seen in instances more recent than that of Rodney.
He clearly had told Sandwich the same in
private letters, for the First Lord writes him, "I
fear the picture you give of the faction in your
fleet is too well drawn. Time and moderation
will by degrees get the better of this bane of discipline.
I exceedingly applaud your resolution
to shut your ears against the illiberal language of
your officers, who are inclined to arraign each
other's conduct." In this two things are to be
remarked: first, the evident and undeniable existence
of serious cause of complaint, which was
preparing Rodney for the stern self-assertion soon
to be shown; and, second, that such imputations
are frequent with him, while he seems in turn to
have had a capacity for eliciting insubordination
of feeling, though he can repress the act. It
is a question of personal temperament, which
explains more than his relations with other men.
Hawke and Nelson find rare fault with those beneath
them; for their own spirit takes possession
of their subordinates. Such difference of spirit
reveals itself in more ways than one in the active
life of a military community.</p>

<p>If there was joy in England over Rodney's
achievement, still more and more sympathetic
was the exultation of those who in the isolation
of Gibraltar's Rock, rarely seeing their country's
flag save on their own flagstaff, witnessed and
shared the triumph of his entrance there with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
train of prizes. The ships of war and transports
forming the convoy did not indeed appear in one
body, but in groups, being dispersed by the light
airs, and swept eastward by the in-drag of the
current from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean;
but the presence of the great fleet, and the prestige
of its recent victory, secured the practical
immunity of merchant vessels during its stay.
Of the first to come in, on January 15th, an eye-witness
wrote, "A ship with the British flag
entering the Bay was so uncommon a sight that
almost the whole garrison were assembled at the
southward to welcome her in; but words are insufficient
to describe their transports on being
informed that she was one of a large convoy
which had sailed the latter end of the preceding
month for our relief." The admiral himself had
been carried beyond and gone into Tetuan, in
Morocco, whence he finally arrived on January
26th, having sent on a supply fleet to Minorca,
the garrison of which was undergoing a severance
from the outer world more extreme even
than that of Gibraltar. Upon the return thence
of the convoying ships he again put to sea, February
13th, with the entire fleet, which accompanied
him three days sail to the westward, when
it parted company for England; he with only
four ships-of-the-line pursuing his way to his station.
On March 27th he reached Santa Lucia,
where he found seventeen of-the-line, composing
his command. Three weeks later he met the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
enemy; barely three months, almost to a day,
after the affair at St. Vincent.</p>

<p>The antecedent circumstances of the war, and
the recent history of the French navy, gave a
singular opportuneness of occasion, and of personal
fitness, to Rodney's arrival at this moment.
The humiliations of the Seven Years War, with
the loss of so much of the French colonial empire,
traceable in chief measure to naval decadence,
had impressed the French government with
the need of reviving their navy, which had consequently
received a material development in quality,
as well as in quantity, unparalleled since the
days of Colbert and Seignelay, near a century
before. Concomitant with this had been a singular
progress in the theory of naval evolutions,
and of their handmaid, naval signalling,
among French officers; an advance to which
the lucid, speculative, character of the national
genius greatly contributed. Although they as
yet lacked practice, and were numerically too
few, the French officers were well equipped by
mental resources, by instruction and reflection,
to handle large fleets; and they now had large
fleets to handle. No such conjunction had
occurred since Tourville; none such recurred
during the Revolution.</p>

<p>The condition was unique in naval history
of the sail period. To meet it, assuming an
approach to equality in contending fleets, was
required, first, a commander-in-chief, and then a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
competent body of officers. The latter the British
had only in the sense of fine seamen and gallant
men. In courage there is no occasion to
institute comparisons between the two nations;
in kind there may have been a difference, but
certainly not in degree. The practical superiority
of seamanship in the British may be taken as a
set-off to the more highly trained understanding
of military principles and methods on the part of
their enemy. For commander-in-chief, there were
at this time but two, Howe and Rodney, whose
professional equipment, as shown in practice,
fitted them to oppose the French methods. Of
these Rodney was the better, because possessed
of a quicker power of initiative, and also of
that personal severity required to enforce strict
conformity of action among indifferent or sullen
subordinates.</p>

<p>Rodney has therefore a singularly well defined
place among British naval chiefs. He was to
oppose form to form, theory to theory, evolution
to evolution, upon the battle ground of the sea;
with purpose throughout tactically offensive, not
defensive, and facing an adversary his equal in
professional equipment. Had he arrived a year
before he would have met no fair match in
D'Estaing, a soldier, not a sailor, whose deficiencies
as a seaman would have caused a very
different result from that which actually followed
his encounter with Byron, who in conduct
showed an utter absence of ideas and of method<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
inconceivable in Rodney. The French were
now commanded by De Guichen, considered the
most capable of their officers by Rodney, whose
recent abode in Paris had probably familiarized
him with professional reputations among the
enemy. Everything therefore conspired to make
the occasion one eminently fitted to his capacities.
Such are the conditions&mdash;the man <i>and</i> the
hour&mdash;that make reputations; though they
do not form characters, which are growths of
radically different origin.</p>

<p>De Guichen put to sea from Martinique on
April 15th, with a convoy for Santo Domingo
which he intended to see clear of British interference.
Rodney, whose anchorage was but
thirty miles away, learned instantly the French
sailing and followed without delay. On the evening
of April 16th, the two fleets were in sight of
each other to leeward of Martinique, the British
to windward; an advantage that was diligently
maintained during the night. At daylight of the
17th the two enemies were twelve to fifteen miles
apart, ranged on nearly parallel lines, the British
twenty heading northwest, the French twenty-three
southeast. The numerical difference represents
sufficiently nearly the actual difference of
force, although French vessels averaged more
powerful than British of the same rates.</p>

<p>At 6.45 A.M. Rodney signalled that it was
his intention to attack the enemy's rear with his
whole force. This was never annulled, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
purpose governed his action throughout the day.
This combination&mdash;on the rear&mdash;is the one
generally preferable to be attempted when underway,
and the relative situations of the fleets at
this moment made it particularly opportune; for
the British, in good order, two cables interval
between the ships, were abreast the rear centre
and rear of the enemy, whose line was in comparison
greatly extended,&mdash;the result probably of
inferior practical seamanship. To increase his
advantage, Rodney at 7 ordered his vessels to close
to one cable, and at 8.30, when the antagonists
were still heading as at daybreak, undertook to
lead the fleet down by a series of signals directive
of its successive movements. In this he was
foiled by De Guichen, who by wearing brought
what was previously his van into position to
support the extreme threatened. "The different
movements of the enemy," wrote Rodney,
"obliged me to be very attentive and watch every
opportunity of attacking them at advantage;"
a sentence that concisely sums up his special
excellencies, of which the present occasion
offers the most complete illustration. It may be
fully conceded also that it would have vindicated
his high title to fame by conspicuous results, had
the intelligence of his officers seconded his
dispositions.</p>

<p>The forenoon passed in manoeuvres, skilfully
timed, to insure a definite issue. At 11.50
Rodney considered that his opportunity had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
arrived. Both fleets were then heading in the
same direction, on the starboard tack, and he had
again succeeded in so placing his own that, by
the words of his report, he expected to bring
"the whole force of His Majesty's fleet against
the enemy's rear, and of course part of their
centre, by which means the twenty sail of British
ships would have been opposed to only fifteen
sail of the enemy's, and must in all probability
have totally disabled them before their van could
have given them any assistance." It would be
difficult to cite a clearer renouncement of the
outworn "van to van," ship to ship, dogma; but
Rodney is said to have expressed himself in more
emphatic terms subsequently, as follows: "During
all the commands Lord Rodney has been
entrusted with, he made it a rule to bring his
whole force against a part of the enemy's, and
never was so absurd as to bring ship against ship,
when the enemy gave him an opportunity of acting
otherwise." Though not distinctly so stated,
it would seem that his first movement on the
present occasion had failed because of the long
distance between the fleets permitting the enemy
to succor the part threatened, before he could
close. He was now nearer, for at this second
attempt only an hour proved to be needed for
the first British ship to open fire at long range.
It may be for this reason, also, that he at this
stage threw himself upon his captains, no longer
prescribing the successive movements, but issuing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the general signal to bear down, each vessel to
"steer," according to the 21st Article of the
<i>Additional</i> Fighting Instructions, "for the ship
of the enemy which from the disposition of the
two squadrons it must be her lot to engage, notwithstanding
the signal for the line ahead will be
kept flying: making or shortening sail in such
proportion as <i>to preserve the distance assigned by
the signal for the line</i>, in order that the whole
squadron may, as near as possible, come into
action at the same time."</p>

<p>Unfortunately for his manoeuvre, the Admiral
here ran up against the stolid idea of the old&mdash;and
still existing&mdash;Fighting Instructions concerning
the line-of-battle in action, embodied in
a typical representative in the senior captain of
his fleet. This gentleman, Robert Carkett, had
risen from before the mast, and after a lieutenancy
of thirteen years had become post in 1758,
by succeeding to the command when his captain
was killed, in one of the most heroic single-ship
fights of the British navy. Unluckily, his seniority
gave him the lead of the fleet as it was now
formed on the starboard tack, and he considered
that the signal for attacking the enemy's rear was
annulled by the present situation. "Both fleets,"
he stated in a letter to the Admiralty, "were at
11.15 parallel to and abreast of each other. As
I was then the leading ship, it became my duty
to engage the leading ship of the French fleet,
as this signal disannulled all former ones rela<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>tive
to the mode of attack." The word "abreast,"
critically used, would imply that the fleets were
abreast, ship to ship, van to van; but there
appears no reason to question Rodney's statement
of the facts made to Carkett himself: "Forgetting
that the signal for the line was only at
two cables length distance from each other, the
van division was by you led to more than two
leagues distance from the centre division, which
was thereby exposed to the greatest strength of
the enemy, and not properly supported." Rodney,
in short, meant by opposite the enemy's ship
opposite at the moment the signal was made;
and he also expected that the movements of his
ships would be further controlled by the words of
the 21st Article, "preserve the distance assigned
by the signal for the line," which distance was
to be taken from the centre; or, as sometimes
worded in the Instructions, "the distance shall
be that between the admiral and the ships next
ahead and astern of him." Carkett conceived
that he was to attack the ship opposite him in
numerical order, that is, the leader of the enemy,
and that the remaining British would take distance
from him.</p>

<p>Why the rest of the van should also have been
led thus astray can be explained only on the
ground that Carkett's general views were shared
by the divisional commander, a rear-admiral, who,
as was proved a year later, possessed high courage
of the pure game-cock order, but was wholly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
thoughtless of gaining an unfair advantage, two
against one, by tactical ingenuity. The result
was that the van as a body left the centre to itself,
and thereby not only wrecked the concentration
at which Rodney aimed, but was out of hand to
support his flag and his division, when badly
battered by the enemy's fire. This was the
great tactical blunder which brought to nought
Rodney's patient, wary manoeuvres of the past
six hours. To it especially, but not to it alone,
he referred in the stinging words of his despatch:
"'T is with concern inexpressible, mixt with indignation,
that the duty I owe my sovereign and
country obliges me to acquaint their Lordships
that, during the action with the French fleet on
the 17th instant [and] His Majesty's, the British
flag was not properly supported." To the specific
error of the van was added a widespread disregard
of the order for close action, despite the
example of the commander-in-chief, who pressed
the enemy so hard that towards the end his
flag-ship was to leeward of De Guichen's wake.
"Perceiving several of our ships engaging at a
distance, I repeated the signal for close action.
With truth, but sorrow, I must say it was little
attended to." It is noticeable that one of the
ships thus censured, the <i>Cornwall</i>, next ahead of
Rodney, lost as heavily in killed and wounded as
did the flag-ship herself; one of many instances
showing that distance lessened efficiency without
increasing safety. The forwardness of Rodney's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
flag on this occasion proves clearly enough his
consciousness that tactics, to succeed, must be
more than a veil for timidity; that hard hitting
is as essential as skilful leading.</p>

<p>This combination of steady, patient, wary, skilful
guidance, with resolute and tenacious personal
leadership, constituted the firm tissue of Rodney's
professional character, and at no time received
such clear illustration as in the case before us;
for no like opportunity recurred. One experience
was enough for De Guichen; he did not choose
again to yield the advantage of the weather gage,
and he had the tactical skill necessary to retain
it in his future contacts with this adversary.
The battle of April 12, 1782, upon which Rodney's
fame has rested, was rather an accident
than an achievement, and as a revelation of character
its most conspicuous feature is wariness
exaggerated into professional timidity. He himself
has weighed the relative professional value
of the two affairs. A letter published in 1809,
anonymous, but bearing strong internal evidence
of being written by Sir Gilbert Blane, long on
a trusted physician's terms of intimacy with Rodney,
states that he "thought little of his victory
on the 12th of April." He would have preferred
to rest his reputation upon this action with De
Guichen, and "looked upon that opportunity of
beating, with an inferior fleet, such an officer,
whom he considered the best in the French service,
as one by which, but for the disobedience of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
his captains, he might have gained an immortal
renown."</p>

<p>The misconduct of his officers brought out in
full vigor the severity which was a salient feature
of Rodney's professional character. In the St.
Vincent business he may have been partly actuated
to spare, by the reflection that the offenders
were not his own captains; that they were about
to quit him finally. Moreover, there had been
then a very considerable tangible success; results
cover a multitude of sins. No such extenuations
applied here. The wreck of his reasonable
hopes of personal distinction coincided with failure
towards the nation itself. Rodney's hand came
down heavy upon the offenders; but so far as
seen it was the hand always of a gentleman. In
private letters his full feelings betrayed themselves
in vehemence; but in public they were
measured to austerity. To Carkett, when questioned
concerning the rumored expressions in his
despatch, he is withering in the pointed enumeration
of varied shortcomings; but he never lapses
into a breach of professional decorum of utterance.
The unfortunate man represented to the
Admiralty his view of the matter,&mdash;already cited;
but it bears no indorsement to show that it had
passed under Rodney's eye. Captain, ship, and
ship's company, were swept away a few months
later in the memorable hurricane of October,
1780.</p>

<p>The despatch specified no other delinquent by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
name; but the selection of five captains to receive
personal commendation, and the persistent refusal
of the same to all other subordinates, including
the junior flag-officers, made censure sufficiently
individual; and the admiral's subsequent line of
conduct emphasized rebuke bitterly. The cruise
was not yet finished; for the French having taken
refuge at Guadaloupe, it was important to prevent
them from regaining Martinique, their chief depot
and place of repairs. To intercept them there,
Rodney at first took station off Fort Royal, and
when compelled for a moment to return to Santa
Lucia, kept lookouts to warn him betimes of the
enemy's appearance. So, when De Guichen approached
from the windward side of the islands,
on May 9th, he found the British getting underway
to meet him. From that time until the 20th&mdash;eleven days&mdash;the
fleets were manoeuvring in
sight of one another, beating to windward; the
British endeavoring to force action, the French
to avoid it. De Guichen's orders from home
were "to keep the sea, so far as the force maintained
by England in the Windward Islands would
permit, <i>without too far compromising</i> the fleet entrusted
to him." Such instructions compelled him
to defensive tactics; as Rodney's views, and those
traditional in his service, impelled him to attack.
Hence ensued a struggle of sustained vigilance,
activity, and skill, profoundly interesting professionally,
but which does not lend itself to other
than technical narrative. "For fourteen days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and nights," wrote Rodney, "the fleets were so
near each other that neither officers nor men
could be said to sleep. Nothing but the goodness
of the weather and climate could have enabled
us to endure so continual a fatigue. Had
it been in Europe, half the people must have
sunk under it. For my part, it did me good."
No evidence of professional aptness could be
given clearer than the last words. A man is
easy under such circumstances only when they fit
him. De Guichen asked to be superseded; "my
health cannot endure such continual fatigue and
anxiety." Twice the wary Frenchman was nearly
caught, but the wind did not favor Rodney long
enough to give him the weather position, the
only sure one for offence. But, while thus unable
to compass results, he gave conclusive evidence
of the quickness of his eye, the alertness
of his action, and the flexibility which he was
enabled to impress upon his fleet by sheer force
of personal character. The contest resembled
that of two expert swordsmen; more intermittent
doubtless, but also much more prolonged.</p>

<p>There can be no trifling with such conditions.
A moment's relaxation, or inaptness, may forfeit
opportunity, offered only by chance and not to be
regained by effort. Rodney was fixed that no
such slip should occur through the neglect of
others, and his stern supervision, as represented
by himself to his wife, was that of a slave driver,
lash in hand. "As I had given public notice to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
all my captains, etc. that I should hoist my flag
on board one of my frigates, and that I expected
implicit obedience to every signal made, under
the certain penalty of being instantly superseded,
it had an admirable effect, as they were all convinced,
after their late gross behaviour, that they
had nothing to expect at my hands but instant
punishment to those who neglected their duty.
My eye on them had more dread than the
enemy's fire, and they knew it would be fatal.
No regard was paid to rank,&mdash;admirals as well
as captains, if out of their station, were instantly
reprimanded by signals, or messages sent by frigates:
and, in spite of themselves, I taught them
to be what they had never been before&mdash;<i>officers</i>:
and showed them that an inferior fleet, properly
conducted, was more than a match for one far
superior." Making allowance for exaggeration in
the irresponsible utterances of family life, the
above is eminently characteristic of temperament.
It must be added, as equally characteristic of an
underlying justice which Rodney possessed, that
in his official account of these last manoeuvres he
gave credit to his subordinates as a whole. "I
must inform their Lordships, in justice to the
commanders and officers of the fleet under my
command, that since the action of the 17th of
April, and during the pursuit of the enemy's fleet,
and in the two rencontres with them, all my officers,
of every rank and denomination, were obedient
and attentive to orders and signals, and, I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
convinced, if the enemy had given them an
opportunity, they would have done their duty to
their King and Country." The claims of justice
against its own strict requirements he also recognized
to Carkett. "Nothing but the former
service you had done your King and Country,
and my firm belief of your being a brave man,
could have induced me, as commander of a great
fleet, to overlook." It will not escape attention
that this exact observance of credit, where due,
lends increased weight to censure, when inflicted.</p>

<p>To the pursuit of the French fleet, relinquished
forty leagues eastward of Martinique
after the brush of May 19th, succeeded a period
marked only by the routine administrative cares
attendant upon an admiral charged with the defence
of a lengthy, exposed chain of islands, and
an extensive trade, against enemies numerically
much superior. The details serve to show the
breadth of intelligence, the sound judgment, and
clear professional conceptions that characterized
Rodney in small things as well as great; but it
would be wearisome to elaborate demonstration of
this, and these qualities he had in common with
many men otherwise inferior to himself. Reaction
from the opening strain of the campaign, with the
relaxation of vigor from the approach of the hot
rainy season, now began to tell on his health; and
to this contributed the harassment of mind due
to the arrival of a large Spanish fleet, while reinforcements
promised him unaccountably failed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
appear. Nevertheless, his personal efficiency was
not impaired, and towards the end of July he
resolved to execute a project which he had long
entertained, of carrying the mass of his fleet from
the islands to the Continental waters of North
America.</p>

<p>During the year between his return from Paris
and his present appointment, he had laid before
the Admiralty two papers, containing an admirable
summary of the leading strategic conditions
of the whole scene of war in the western hemisphere,
with suggestions for action amounting
to a plan of campaign. One feature of this was
based upon the weather differences, which rendered
cruising dangerous in the West Indies
when most favorable to the northward, and unsure
in North America when most certain among
the islands. He proposed to utilize this alternation
of seasons, by shifting a mobile reinforcement
suddenly and secretly from one end to the other
of the long front of operations. This is a common
enough expedient in military art, but had
rarely received the convincing formulation which
he gave it; while that such a conception was a
novelty to the average naval mind of the day, may
be inferred from the startled wrath of the admiral
in North America at Rodney's unexpected intrusion
upon his bailiwick.</p>

<p>Sandwich, however, had entertained the project,
and in October, 1779, just as Rodney's appointment
issued, a vessel sailed from England with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
letters to Admiral Arbuthnot in New York,
directing him to send several ships-of-the-line to
the West Indies for the winter campaign. The
vessel lost a mast, kept off to Nassau in the
Bahamas, and after arrival there her captain,
while spending some months in repairs, did not
think to send on the despatches. Arbuthnot,
therefore, received them only on March 16, 1780;
too late, doubtless, to collect and equip a force
in time to reach Rodney before the affair of
April 17th.</p>

<p>At the end of July, 1780, the conditions in the
West Indies were that the allied French and
Spanish fleets had gone to leeward from Martinique;
to Havana, and to Cap Fran&ccedil;ois, in Hayti.
At the latter port was assembling a large trade
convoy&mdash;three hundred ships, according to Rodney's
information. He reasoned that this must
go to Europe, but would not require the full
strength of the French fleet; therefore, transferring
his own insight to the enemy's mind, he convinced
himself that a part of their vessels would
seek Narragansett Bay, to reinforce the seven
ships-of-the-line that had reached there on July
12th, under De Ternay, of whose arrival Rodney
now knew. Great possibilities might be open to
such a combination, skilfully handled against the
inferior numbers of Arbuthnot. "As it plainly
appeared to me that His Majesty's territory, fleet,
and army, in America were in imminent danger
of being overpowered by the superior force of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the public enemy, I deemed it a duty incumbent
upon me to forego any emoluments that might
have accrued by the enterprise intended by General
Vaughan and myself during the hurricane
months, and without a moment's hesitation flew
with all despatch possible to prevent the enemy's
making any impression upon the continent before
my arrival there." The protestation of disinterestedness
here is somewhat intrusive, and being
wholly unnecessary excites rather criticism than
confidence.</p>

<p>Although reasonable precautions had been
taken for the security of his own station, and all
circumstances carefully weighed, there was in
this step of Rodney's an assumption of responsibility,&mdash;of
risk,&mdash;as in his similar action of
1762, before noted. This, as well as the military
correctness of the general conception, deserves to
be noted to the credit of his professional capacity.
Making the land about Charleston, South Carolina,
he swept along the coast to the northward,
until he anchored off Sandy Hook, September
14th. The following day he issued an order
to Admiral Arbuthnot, directing him to put
himself under his command and to obey his
instructions.</p>

<p>Rodney's coming was a grievous blow to Washington,
who instead had hoped, as Rodney had
feared, the arrival of De Guichen, or at the least
of a strong French naval division. The enemy's
disappointment is perhaps the best proof of sagac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>ity
in a military movement, but Sandwich's clear
approval was also forthcoming. "It is impossible
for us to have a superior fleet in every part; and
unless our commanders-in-chief will take the great
line, as you do, and consider the King's whole
dominions as under their care, our enemies must
find us unprepared somewhere, and carry their
point against us." Arbuthnot, nevertheless, saw
only personal injury to himself; a natural feeling,
but one which should not be allowed display.
Rodney had given various particular orders, and
had suggested that it would be better that the
commander-in-chief on the station should keep
headquarters at New York, leaving the blockade
of Ternay, a hundred and thirty miles distant, to
a junior admiral; also, he intimated the opinion
that such a blockade would be better conducted
underway than anchored in Gardiner's Bay, fifty
miles from the enemy's port. Though suggestion
did not override discretion, Arbuthnot resented
it in all its forms. After explaining his
reasons, he added, "How far, Sir, your conduct
(similarly circumstanced as you are) is praiseworthy
and proper, consequences must determine.
Your partial interference in the conduct of the
American War is certainly incompatible with
principles of reason, and precedents of service.
The frigates attending on a cruising squadron
you have taken upon you to counter-order, (a due
representation of which and other circumstances
I shall make where it will have every possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
effect), and thus I have been for some time without
even a repeater of signals."</p>

<p>Though Rodney's step was unusual, his position
as Arbuthnot's superior officer, locally present,
was impregnable. He nevertheless kept his
temper under provocation, and the dignified
restraint of his reply is notable; indeed, the
only significant feature of this incident, from the
biographical point of view. "No offence to you
was intended on my part. Every respect due to
you, as an officer and a gentleman, my inclination
as well as my duty led me to pay you in the
strictest sense." He leaves no doubt, however,
that he does not intend to allow his functions to
lapse into a mere official primacy,&mdash;that he will
rule, as well as reign. "Duty, not inclination,
brought me to North America. I came to interfere
in the American War, to command by sea in
it, and to do my best endeavours towards the
putting an end thereto. I knew the dignity of
my own rank entitled me to take the supreme
command, which I ever shall do on every station
where His Majesty's and the public service may
make it necessary for me to go, unless I meet a
superior officer, in which case it will be my duty
to obey his orders." He then proceeds to exercise
his authority, by explicit directions and some
criticism of existing arrangements.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in submitting the papers to the
Admiralty, Rodney wrote, "I am ashamed to
mention what appears to me the real cause, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
from whence Mr. Arbuthnot's chagrin proceeds,
but the proofs are so plain that prize-money is
the occasion that I am under the necessity of
transmitting them. I can solemnly assure their
Lordships that I had not the least conception of
any other prize-money on the coast of America
but that which would be most honourably obtained
by the destruction of the enemy's ships of
war and privateers&mdash;but when prize-money appeared
predominant in the mind of my brother
officer, I was determined to have my share
of that bounty so graciously bestowed by His
Majesty and the public." Nelson's retort to
Arbuthnot's successor, two years later, may be
recalled. "You have come to a good station
for prize-money." "Yes, but the West Indies is
the station for honour."</p>

<p>The visit to continental waters was on this occasion
productive of little result. Contrary alike
to Rodney's anticipations and those of Washington,
De Guichen's whole fleet had returned to
Europe. Some slight redistribution of cruisers,
the more frequent capture of privateers, with increased
security to the trade of New York and
incidental support to some rather predatory land
operations, were all that Rodney could show of
tangible consequence from his presence. Arbuthnot
alone was superior to Ternay if neither received
reinforcements. Rodney's health felt the
keener atmosphere, so that he had to go ashore
in New York, and he accepted the views of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Arbuthnot as to the strength of the French
fleet's position in Newport, without examining
it himself. Had he done so, however, it is unlikely
that he would have formed more strenuous
purposes. The disposition of the enemy's
squadron there was so imposing that only the
genius of a Nelson, mindful as at Revel of the
moral influence of a great blow at a critical
period of the war, could have risen to the necessity
of daring such a hazard. His phrase was
there applicable, "Desperate affairs require desperate
remedies." There is no indication of this
supreme element in Rodney's composition. It is
interesting to note, however, that personal observation
had given conviction of success at Newport
to the officer who was afterwards Nelson's
gallant second at Copenhagen,&mdash;Sir Thomas
Graves.</p>

<p>This paucity of results in no way lessens the
merit of the movement from the West Indies to
the continent. It was indubitably correct in idea,
and, as has been pointed out, the conception was
Rodney's own, the possibilities were great, the
risk in many ways undeniable; when these can
be affirmed of a military action, failure to obtain
results, because conditions take an improbable
direction, does not detract from credit. Nor
should the obviousness of this measure hide the
fact that the suggestion appears to have been
original with him, occurring fully developed in
his memorandum of May, 1778, to the Admi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>ralty;
whether written in Paris or England does
not appear. The transfer of Hotham's squadron
to the southward in the following December,
1779, enabling Barrington to conquer Santa
Lucia,&mdash;a place insisted upon in the same memorandum
as of the first importance,&mdash;may not
improbably be attributed to this fruitful paper.
In the next year, 1781, a detachment was again
sent to New York, and had Rodney been able
to accompany it in person there is no room
to doubt that he would have saved Cornwallis;
reversing issues, at least momentarily, certainly
prolonging the war, possibly deciding the contest
otherwise than as befell.</p>

<p>Rodney's return to the West Indies in December,
1780, concluded the most eventful and
illustriously characteristic year of his life. The
destruction of Langara's fleet in January, the
brilliant tactical displays of April 17th, and of
the chase manoeuvres in May, the strategic transference
in August of a large division, unawares to
the enemy, from one point of the field of action
to another, are all feats that testify to his great
ability as a general officer. Nor should there be
left out of the account the stern dignity of conduct
which assured his personal control of the
fleet, his certainty of touch in the face of an
enemy. Thus considered, it was a year full of
events, successful throughout as regards personal
desert, and singularly significant of ability
and temperament.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>The year 1781 was far less happy, nor does the
great victory, which in 1782 crowned his career
with glory, contribute to the enhancement of
his professional distinction; rather the contrary.
Upon reaching Barbados, December 5th, he
found the island shorn to the ground by the
noted hurricane, which in the previous October
had swept the Caribbean, from the Lesser Antilles
to Jamaica. Eight of the division left by him in
the West Indies had been wrecked,&mdash;two being
ships-of-the-line; and the efficiency of the whole
fleet was grievously impaired by the widespread
injury to vessels.</p>

<p>An event charged with more serious consequences
to himself soon followed. On the 27th
of January, 1781, at Barbados, despatches from
the Admiralty notified him that Great Britain
had declared war against Holland, and directed
him to proceed at once against the Dutch
shipping and West Indies. First among the
enumerated objects of attack was the small island
of St. Eustatius. This, having enjoyed the advantages
of neutrality at a time when almost the
whole Caribbean was in hostilities, had become a
depot for the accumulation and distribution of
stores, commercial and warlike. Ostensibly, it
served all parties, giving to and receiving from
Europe, America, and the Caribbean alike. The
political sympathies of Holland, however, and it
may be added those of the West Indies in general,
even of the British islands themselves, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
rather adverse to Great Britain in the current
struggle; and this, combined with the greater
self-sufficingness of the British naval and commercial
administration, had made the neutral support
of St. Eustatius more benevolent, and much more
useful, to the enemies of Great Britain, including
the revolted colonists, than it was to the
mother country. Rodney asserted that help
from there was readily forthcoming to supply
French and Spanish requirements, while professions
of inability abounded whenever his fleet
made a demand in occasional emergencies.</p>

<p>He was therefore full of gall against the island
and its merchants, the more so because he suspected
that British subjects, unpatriotically ardent
for gain, were largely concerned in maintaining
conditions thus hurtful to their country; and,
when the orders to act came, it needed but three
days for himself and General Vaughan to sail
on an errand of which they probably had previous
intimations. On the 3d of February they
arrived off St. Eustatius, which in the face of
their imposing force submitted at once. They
took possession of the island, with goods stored
to the estimated value of &pound;3,000,000,&mdash;an immense
spoil in those days. A Dutch ship-of-war,
with a hundred and fifty sail of traders of various
nationalities, were also seized; while a convoy of
thirty merchant ships, which had sailed thirty-six
hours before, was pursued and captured by a
British detachment,&mdash;the Dutch admiral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
commanding the ships-of-war being killed in the attendant
action.</p>

<p>From one point of view this was an enormous
success, though unproductive of glory. It destroyed
at a blow a centre of commerce and supply
powerfully contributive to the maintenance of
the enemies of Great Britain; both to their
hostile operations, and to the indirect but no less
vital financial support that trade gives to national
endurance,&mdash;to the sinews of war. Besides this,
however, there was the unprecedented immediate
booty, transferable as so much asset to the
conquerors. It was upon this present tangible
result that Rodney's imagination fastened, with
an engrossment and tenacity that constitute a
revelation of character. It perverted his understanding
of conditions, and paralyzed his proper
action as commander-in-chief. It is needless in
this connection to consider whether it was the
matter of personal profit, through legitimate prize-money,
that thus influenced him,&mdash;an effect to
some extent pardonable in a man who had long
suffered, and still was suffering, from pecuniary
straitness,&mdash;or whether, as he loudly protested,
it was the interest to the nation that made his
personal superintendence of the proceeds imperative.
In either case the point to be noted is not
a palpable trait of covetousness,&mdash;if such it were,&mdash;but
the limitation to activity occasioned by
preoccupation with a realized, but imperfect, success.
The comparatively crude impression of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
greediness, produced by apparent absorption in a
mere money gain, has prevented the perception
of this more important and decisive element in
Rodney's official character, revealed at St. Eustatius
and confirmed on the evening of the 12th of
April. What he had won, he had won; what
more he might and should do, he would not see,
nor would he risk.</p>

<p>His discontent with his junior flag-officers in
the West Indies, and the peculiar demoralization
of professional tone at the moment, had made it
difficult for the Admiralty to provide him a satisfactory
second in command. In order to do
this, they had "to make a promotion," as the
phrase went; that is, in order to get the man
wanted, the seniors on the captains' list were promoted
down to and including him. The choice
had fallen on Sir Samuel Hood,&mdash;in later days
Nelson's honored Lord Hood,&mdash;than which none
could have been happier in respect of capacity.
It has been truly said that he was as able as
Rodney, and more energetic; but even this falls
short of his merit. He had an element of professional&mdash;as
distinguished from personal&mdash;daring,
and an imaginative faculty that penetrated
the extreme possibilities of a situation, quickened
by the resolve, in which Rodney was deficient, to
have all or nothing; and these invaluable traits
were balanced by the sound and accurate judgment
of a thorough seaman, without which imagination
lures to disaster. The man who as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
junior formed the idea of seizing De Grasse's
anchorage in the Chesapeake in 1781, to effect
the relief of Cornwallis, and who in 1782, when
momentarily in chief command, illustrated the
idea by actual performance under similar conditions
in the West Indies, rose to heights of conception
and of achievement for which we have no
equivalent in Rodney's career. Unfortunately for
him, though thus mighty in act, opportunity for
great results never came to him. The hour never
met the man.</p>

<p>Hood with eight ships-of-the-line and a large
convoy arrived on the station in January, 1781,
and was at St. Eustatius with the commander-in-chief
when Rodney received a report, which
proved to be false, that eight to ten French ships-of-the-line,
with a numerous supply-fleet, had been
sighted in European waters evidently bound for
the West Indies. He thereupon detached Hood,
on February 12th, and directed him with seventeen
of-the-line to await the enemy to windward
of Martinique, their probable destination. A
month later he ordered the position to be shifted
to leeward of the island, in front of the French
arsenal port, Fort Royal. Hood dissented from
this, remonstrating vigorously, and the event
proved him right; but Rodney insisted, the more
injudiciously in that he was throwing the tactical
burden upon his junior while fettering thus his
tactical discretion. Meantime, twenty French
ships-of-the-line did sail on March 22d for Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>tinique,
under Count De Grasse: beginning then
the campaign which ended in the great disaster of
April 12, 1782, but not until it had been signalized
by the surrender of Cornwallis, due to this
fleet, as Washington said. On the 28th of April
it came in sight of Hood; but, owing to the leewardly
position insisted upon by Rodney, the
English commander could not prevent the junction
to it of four French ships then in the port.
A battle followed next day, of eighteen British&mdash;one
having just joined&mdash;against twenty-four
enemies; odds which, combined with the weather
gage held by the French, should have insured
them a decisive victory. This result was prevented
by the tentative action of De Grasse,
encountering the tactical capacity and imperturbable
self-possession of Hood.</p>

<p>Rodney could not have bettered Hood's management,
though he of course attributed to him
the blame for results. It is evident, however,
that for various reasons the commander-in-chief
should have been with the body of his fleet.
Even barring certain and timely information of
the French coming, which Hood at least did not
have, there was every reasonable probability that
such an expedition would arrive at about the season
it did. Hood's insight, which was adequate
to divining possibilities as well as to dealing with
ascertained conditions, had taught him that the
latter half of April&mdash;and not sooner&mdash;was the
time by which the British should be refitted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
provisioned and watered full, and in all respects
ready for prolonged operations against a powerful
enemy; as well as concentrated to windward. He
reasoned thus from the fact that the French navy,
to the number of forty odd,&mdash;being the combined
fleets of D'Estaing from Brest and De Guichen
from the West Indies,&mdash;had been assembled in
Cadiz towards the end of 1780, and did not return
to Brest until January, 1781. To refit, sail, and
reach Martinique again, would in his judgment
postpone arrival to the middle of April, and this
respite should be improved by getting the British
ships into the best campaigning condition, so as
not to be hampered in subsequent movements
by necessities of repair and supply. With this
persuasion he became eager, by the first of the
month, for the admiral's presence; the more so
because confident that, if he were on the spot, he
would see the necessity of changing position from
leeward to windward. "I begin to be extremely
impatient for the honour of being and acting
immediately under your flag, as I do not find
myself pleasant in being to leeward; for should an
enemy's fleet attempt to get into Martinique, and
the commander of it inclines to avoid battle,
nothing but a skirmish will probably happen,
which in its consequences may operate as a defeat
to the British squadron, though not a ship is lost
and the enemy suffer most."</p>

<p>This is a clear case in which events that actually
befell were foreseen; not by supernatural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
illumination, but by the clear light of unbiassed
reason acting upon evident considerations.
There <i>was</i> but a skirmish, the British <i>did</i> suffer
badly, and the consequences <i>were</i> equivalent to
defeat; for, had the whole British force of the
line been present to windward, it would have
prevented the junction of the French, and therefore
have been so nearly equal to the main body
as to have assured an action inflicting very
serious injury, incapacitating the enemy for the
attacks upon Santa Lucia and Tobago, before
which the latter fell, and not improbably deterring
De Grasse from the expedition to the Chesapeake
which forced the capitulation of Cornwallis.
Such deductions are of course dependent upon
the contingencies inseparable from warfare.
They are not certainties, indeed; but they are
inferences of very great probability. So much
hinged upon the presence of an officer with the
full discretion denied to Hood; of the officer
primarily responsible for the fleet, which was
intrusted to him and not to another.</p>

<p>Probable also is Hood's solution of Rodney's
persistence in remaining at St. Eustatius, and
keeping the squadron under the command of his
second to leeward of Martinique. He was possessed
with the fancied paramount necessity of
protecting St. Eustatius against a sudden attack
by the enemy, which he imagined might be supported
by the small division in Fort Royal; and
the value of the booty shut his eyes to every other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
consideration. As on the evening of the 12th
of April, the great day of glory in his career, the
captures already made assumed sufficiency in
his eyes, and co-operating with surmisings as to
what the beaten and scattered French might do
deterred him from further action; so now the
prize already secured at St. Eustatius combined
with the imaginative "picture he made for himself"&mdash;to
use Napoleon's phrase&mdash;of its possible
dangers, to blind him to the really decisive
needs of the situation. It is clear, however, that
local naval provision for the safety of a petty
island was in point of difficulty, as of consequence,
a secondary matter, within the competence
of many of his captains; and that the
primary factor, on which all depended, was the
control of the sea, by the British fleet predominating
over the enemy's. Consequently the
commander-in-chief should have been where his
second was, at the centre of decisive action,
where an enemy's fleet was to be expected.</p>

<p>This was the more incumbent because Rodney
himself, writing to Admiral Parker in Jamaica on
April 16th, said, "As the enemy hourly expect
a great fleet in these seas, I have scarcely a
sufficient number of line-of-battle-ships to blockade
the island of Martinique, or to engage the
enemy's fleet should they appear, if their number
should be so large as reported,"&mdash;twenty-four.
This report came from French sources, and it
will be noted, from the date of his letter, was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
his possession twelve days before the enemy
arrived. It was both specific and antecedently
probable, and should have determined the admiral's
action. Whether he had similar news
from home does not appear. Sandwich writing
him on March 21st, the day before the French
left Brest, professed ignorance of their destination,
but added, "the most prevailing and most probable
opinion is that they are to go to the West India
Islands, and afterwards to North America."
Their number he estimated at twenty-five, which
tallied with Rodney's intelligence of twenty-four.
The latter was exact, save that four were armed
<i>en fl&ucirc;te</i>; that is, as transports, with their guns
below, to be subsequently mounted. Despite
everything, the admiral remained at St. Eustatius
until May 4th, when the arrival of a crippled ship
from Hood brought him the news of the skirmish.
He was attending, doubtless, to details pertaining
to his command, but he was chiefly occupied with
the disposition of the property seized on the
island; a matter which he afterwards found to
his cost would have been much better committed
to administrators skilled in the law. "Had they
abided by the first plan settled before I left them,"
wrote Hood, "and not have interfered, but have
left the management to the land and sea folk
appointed for that purpose, all would have gone
smooth and easy."</p>

<p>However this might have proved, the immediate
supervision of the island and its spoils was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
business for a commander-in-chief in active war
time; particularly when it entailed leaving the
charge of his main fleet, at a critical moment, to
a junior admiral of very recent appointment, and
still unproved. It was not the separate importance
of the position intrusted to Hood that made
it peculiarly the station for the commander-in-chief.
It might have been intrinsically as important,
yet relatively secondary; but actually it
was the centre and key upon which, and upon
which alone, the campaign could turn and did
turn. Neither was the question one of the relative
merits, as yet unknown, of Rodney and
Hood. A commander-in-chief cannot devolve
his own proper functions upon a subordinate,
however able, without graver cause than can be
shown in this instance. The infatuation which
detained Rodney at a side issue can only be excused&mdash;not
justified&mdash;by a temporary inability
to see things in their true proportion, induced on
more than one occasion by a temperamental
defect,&mdash;the lack of the single eye to military
considerations,&mdash;which could find contentment
in partial success, and be indifferent to further
results to be secured by sustained action.</p>

<p>There is a saying, apt to prove true, that war
does not forgive. For his initial error Rodney
himself, and the British campaign in general,
paid heavily throughout the year 1781. The
French fleet in undiminished vigor lay a dead
weight upon all his subsequent action, which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
like the dispositions prior to its arrival, underwent
the continued censure of Hood; acrid, yet
not undiscriminating nor misplaced. As already
observed, the surrender of Cornwallis can with
probability be ascribed to this loss of an opportunity
afforded to strike a blow at the outset,
when the enemy was as yet divided, embarrassed
with convoy, raw in organization and drill, in all
which it could not but improve as the months
passed. The results began at once to be apparent,
and embarrassments accumulated with
time. Hood's ships, though no one was wholly
disabled, had suffered very considerably; and,
while indispensable repairs could temporarily be
made, efficiency was affected. They needed, besides,
immediate water and supplies, as Rodney
himself stated&mdash;a want which Hood would have
anticipated. To increase difficulty, the French
mounted the batteries of the vessels <i>en fl&ucirc;te</i>, and
so raised their total nominal force to twenty-eight.
Hood was unable to regain Santa Lucia, because
his crippled ships could not beat against the
current. He therefore left it to itself, and bore
away to the northward, where he joined Rodney
on May 11th, between St. Kitts and Antigua.
The campaign of 1781, destined to be wholly defensive
for the British, opened under these odds,
the responsibility for which lies in considerable
measure on Rodney.</p>

<p>After the junction, the British fleet went to
Barbados, where it arrived May 18th. Mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>time,
the French had proceeded in force against
Santa Lucia, landing a considerable body of
troops, and investing the island with twenty-five
sail-of-the-line, two of which with 1300 soldiers
went on to attempt the British Tobago. The
attack on Santa Lucia failed, and the French returned
to Martinique; but learning there that
Rodney was at sea, heading southward, De Grasse
became alarmed for his detachment at Tobago,
and moved to its support with his entire fleet.
Rodney, knowing of the detachment only, sent
against it six ships under Rear Admiral Drake;
a half-measure severely censured by Hood, whose
comments throughout indicate either a much superior
natural sagacity, or else the clearer insight
of a man whose eye dwells steadfastly on the military
situation, untroubled by conflicting claims.
"What a wonderful happy turn would have been
given to the King's affairs in this country had Sir
George Rodney gone with his whole force to
Tobago as soon as he might, and in my humble
opinion ought to have done. Nay, had he even
gone when Mr. Drake did, the island would have
been saved. I laboured much to effect it, but all
in vain, and fully stated my reasons in writing as
soon as the intelligence came. Every ship there
with all the troops must have fallen into our hands
two days before De Grasse got there with his
twenty-one sail;" to which Rodney, in full strength,
would again have opposed twenty. "<i>Now</i> the
enemy may do as they will;" for they were united<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
in Martinique, twenty-eight to twenty. In short,
Rodney saw at Tobago only the one French
detachment; Hood saw therein the definition of
the enemy's purpose, the necessity laid on them
to fly to the aid of their exposed division, and the
chance to anticipate them,&mdash;to gain an advantage
first, and to beat them afterwards.</p>

<p>Rodney's tentative and inadequate action was
not improbably induced partly by the "extreme
want of water," which he reported in his despatches;
and this again was due to failure to
prepare adequately during the period of respite
foreseen by Hood, but unnoted by his own preoccupied
mind. The result is instructive. Drake
fell in with the main body of the French, and of
course had to retire,&mdash;fortunate in regaining
his commander-in-chief unmolested. De Grasse's
movement had become known in Barbados, and
as soon as Drake appeared Rodney sailed with
the fleet, but upon arriving off Tobago, on June
5th, learned that it had surrendered on the 2d. Its
fall he duly attributed to local neglect and cowardice;
but evidently the presence of the British
fleet might have had some effect. He then returned
to Barbados, and during the passage the
hostile fleets sighted each other on the 9th,&mdash;twenty
British to twenty-three French; but Rodney
was unwilling to engage lest he might be
entangled with the foul ground about Grenada.
As that island was then in the enemy's hands, he
could get no anchorage there, and so might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
driven to leeward of his opponent, exposing Barbados.
It is perhaps needless to point out that
had he been to windward of Martinique when De
Grasse first arrived, as Hood wished, he would
have been twenty to twenty, with clear ground,
and the antagonist embarrassed with convoy.
His present perplexities, in their successive
phases, can be seen throughout to be the result
of sticking to St. Eustatius, not only physically,
but mentally.</p>

<p>And so it was with what followed. On reaching
Barbados again, he had to report that the
French were back in Martinique, and now twenty-eight
through the arming of the ships <i>en fl&ucirc;te</i>.
Despite their superiority, "they do not venture
to move," he said somewhat sneeringly, and doubtless
his "fleet in being" had an effect on them;
but they were also intent on a really great
operation. On July 5th, De Grasse sailed for
Cap Fran&ccedil;ois in Hayti, there to organize a visit
to the continent in support of Washington's
operations. Rodney, pursuant to his sagacious
plan of the previous years, sent also a detachment
of fourteen ships under Hood, which he
endeavored, but unsuccessfully, to have increased
by some from Jamaica. That De Grasse would
take his whole fleet to North America, leaving
none in the West Indies, nor sending any to
Europe, was a step that neither Rodney nor
Hood foresaw. The miscalculation cannot be
imputed to either as an error at this time. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
was simply one of the deceptions to which the
defensive is ever liable; but it is fairly chargeable
to the original fault whereby the French admiral
was enabled to enter Fort Royal uninjured in
the previous April. From the time his fleet
was concentrated, the British had to accept the
defensive with its embarrassments.</p>

<p>Rodney had contemplated going in person with
his ships, which Sandwich also had urged upon
him; but his health was seriously impaired, and
the necessity for a surgical operation combined
to induce his return to England. The final decision
on this point he postponed to the last moment
of the homeward voyage, keeping a frigate
in company in which to go to New York, if
able; but ultimately he felt compelled to give
up. This conclusion settled Cornwallis's fate,
antecedently but finally. That year Great Britain
fell between two stools. In view of De Grasse's
known expressions, it may be affirmed with great
confidence that he would have seen reason to
abandon the Chesapeake, leaving open the sea road
for Cornwallis to escape, had either Rodney
or Hood commanded the British fleet there in
the battle of September 5th; but Rodney was
away, and Hood second only to an incompetent
superior.</p>

<p>Rodney landed in England, September 19th,
and was again afloat by December 12th, although
he did not finally sail for his station until the
middle of January, 1782. This brief period was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
one of the deepest military depression; for during
it occurred Cornwallis's surrender, October 19th,
under conditions of evident British inferiority,
on sea and shore alike, which enforced the conviction
that the colonies must be granted their
independence. Not only so, but the known
extensive preparations of the Bourbon courts
pointed to grave danger also for the Caribbean
colonies, the sugar and import trade of which
counted largely in the financial resources of the
empire. Amid the general gloom Rodney had
his own special vexation; for, before he left, news
was received of the recapture of St. Eustatius
by a small French expedition, prior to the return
of Hood to the West Indies from the unfortunate
operations on the continent. As in
the case of Tobago, Rodney severely blamed the
local defence, and very possibly justly; but attention
should not wander from the effect that must
have been produced upon all subsequent conditions
by preparation and action on the part of
the British fleet, in the spring of 1781, on the
lines then favored by Hood.</p>

<p>Shortly before he had sailed for home, Rodney
had written his wife, "In all probability, the
enemy, when they leave these seas, will go to
America. Wherever they go, I will watch their
motions, and certainly attack them if they give
me a proper opportunity. The fate of England
may depend upon the event." The last sentence
was in measure a prophecy, so far, that is, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
decisive of the original issue at stake,&mdash;the subjugation
or independence of the United Colonies;
but, without further laboring the point
unduly, it may be permitted here to sum up
what has been said, with the remark that in the
summer of 1781 control of events had passed out
of Rodney's hands. From the time of the original
fault, in suffering the French to meet Hood to
leeward of Martinique, with an inferior force,
more and more did it become impossible to him
to assure conditions sufficiently favorable. With
the highest personal courage, he did not have
eminent professional daring; nor, with considerable
tactical acquirement, was he gifted with
that illuminative originality which characterized
Hood and Nelson. He therefore needed either
a reasonable probability of success, or the spur
of imminent emergency, to elicit the kind of
action needed to save the British cause. The
chances to windward of Martinique would have
been ninety out of a hundred; from that time
forward they diminished with continually increasing
rapidity. With such a situation he was not
the man to cope.</p>

<p>On reaching Barbados, February 19, 1782,
Rodney learned that the garrison of St. Kitts
was besieged in Brimstone Hill, and the island
itself beleaguered by the French fleet, thirty-three
of-the-line, which Sir Samuel Hood, with
two thirds their number, had so far held in check
by a series of manoeuvres unusually acute in conception<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
and brilliant in execution. Proceeding
immediately to Antigua, he there heard on the
23d that St. Kitts had capitulated on the 13th.
Two days later he was joined by Hood, and then
took the united fleet to Santa Lucia, where he
was on March 5th. The knowledge of a large
supply fleet expected for the French, and essential
to the known project of the allies against
Jamaica, carried the British fleet again to sea;
but it failed to intercept the convoy, and returned
once more to Santa Lucia, where it anchored in
Gros Ilet Bay, thirty miles from Fort Royal,
where the French were lying. Various changes
made the respective numbers, when operations
opened, British thirty-six of-the-line, French
thirty-five, with two fifty-gun ships; a near approach
to equality.</p>

<p>Rodney's faculties were now all alert. He had
had some needed repose, and he was again under
the stimulus of reputation to restore; for it would
have been vain to assert, even to himself, that he
was entirely clear, not merely of error, to which
the most careful is liable, but of serious fault in
the previous year. Moreover, he had been
sharply assailed in Parliament for the transactions
at St. Eustatius on the civil side, distinct
from his military conduct. To such ills there is
no plaster so healing as a victory; and the occasion
about to arise proved, in its successive stages,&mdash;until
the last,&mdash;admirably adapted to his
natural and acquired qualifications. First, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
series of manoeuvres protracted over three or four
days; and afterwards a hard fought battle, converted
by a happy yet by no means unusual accident
into a decided and showy success. Decided,
but not decisive; for, like the soldier desperate
in deed before rewarded, but who, when summoned
again, advised that the chance be given to
a man who had not a purse of gold, Rodney preferred
to pause on that personally safe side of
moderation in achievement which is rarely conducive
to finality, and is nowhere so ill-placed as
in the aims of a commander-in-chief. The true
prudence of war,&mdash;as it is also its mercy, to
friend and to foe,&mdash;is to strike without cessation
or slackness till power of future action is crushed.</p>

<p>De Grasse's immediate task was to protect a
large convoy from Martinique to Cap Fran&ccedil;ois
(now Cap Haytien), in Hayti, a distance of about
a thousand miles. Cumbered with merchant
vessels, and aware that Rodney would be at once
on his track, he could not go straight across the
Caribbean; the British fleet, not so hampered,
would be sure to overtake and destroy. He
purposed, therefore, to skirt the Antilles, keeping
continually in reach of a port of refuge.
Rodney, knowing the aim to be Jamaica, had
little doubt of overtaking in any case, if started
promptly. He therefore kept himself in signal
touch of Fort Royal by a chain of frigates, extending
from its offing to his own anchorage.</p>

<p>On the 8th of April the French sailed. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
British followed instantly, and before sundown
had them in sight, not only by lookout vessels,
but from the mastheads of the main fleet. At
daybreak next morning they were visible from
the decks of the British van; a very marked gain.
De Grasse saw that at that rate, unless he got rid
of the convoy, he would certainly be overtaken,
which it was his aim to elude in pursuance of the
usual French policy of ulterior purposes; so,
being then north of Dominica, he sent the merchant
vessels into Guadaloupe, and undertook
to carry the ships-of-war through the passage
between the two islands, beating to windward.
This would draw the British away from the convoy,
unless they were content to let the fleet go,
which was not to be expected.</p>

<p>Between 8 A.M. and 2 P.M. of April 9th, several
sharp skirmishes took place between the
French and the British van, under Hood.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
De Grasse had here an opportunity of crushing a
fraction of the enemy, but failed to use it, thus
insuring his own final discomfiture. Rodney,
who was becalmed with the centre and rear of
his command, could do nothing but push forward
reinforcements to Hood as the wind served; and
this he did. Pursuit was maintained tenaciously
during the following night and the next two days,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>&mdash;April
10th and 11th; but in sustained chases of
bodies of ships, the chased continually drops units,
which must be forsaken or else the retreat of the
whole must be retarded. So in this case, certain
of De Grasse's ships were either so leewardly or
so ill handled that the bulk of the fleet, which
had gained considerably to windward, had to bear
down to them, thus losing the ground won.
Under such circumstances the chapter of accidents&mdash;or
of incidents&mdash;frequently introduces
great results; and so it proved here.</p>

<p>At 2 A.M. of April 12th, De Grasse's flag-ship,
the <i>Ville de Paris</i>, and the seventy-four-gun ship
<i>Z&eacute;l&eacute;</i>, crossing on opposite tacks, came into collision.
The former received little damage, but the <i>Z&eacute;l&eacute;</i>
lost her foremast and bowsprit. De Grasse then
ordered her into Guadaloupe, in tow of a frigate.
When day broke, about five o'clock, these two were
only about six miles from the British rear, under
Hood, whose division had been shifted from the
van in consequence of injuries received on the
9th. The British column was then standing
east-northeast, closehauled on the starboard tack,
the crippled vessel under its lee, but the French
of the main body well to windward. To draw
them within reach, Rodney signalled Hood to
send chasers after the <i>Z&eacute;l&eacute;</i>. De Grasse took the
bait and ran down to her support, ordering his
ships to form line-of-battle on the port tack, which
was done hastily and tumultuously. The two
lines on which the antagonists were respectively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
advancing now pointed to a common and not
distant point of intersection, which the French,
despite the loss of ground already undergone,
reached first, passing in front and to windward of
the head of the British column. Eight ships thus
went by clear, but the ninth arrived at the same
moment with the leading British vessel, which
put her helm up and ran along close to leeward
of the French line towards its rear, followed in
so doing by the rest of her fleet.</p>

<p>The battle thus assumed the phase of two
fleets passing each other in opposite directions,
on parallel lines; a condition usually unproductive
of results, and amounting to little more than
a brush, as had been the case in two rencounters
between Rodney and De Guichen in the prolonged
chase of May, 1780. Chance permitted a
different issue on this occasion. The wind at
the moment of first collision, shortly before 8
A.M., was east, and so continued till five minutes
past nine, when it shifted suddenly to the southeastward,
ahead for the French, abaft for the
British. The former, being already close to the
wind, could keep their sails full only by bearing
away, which broke up their line ahead, the order
of battle as ranged for mutual support; while
the British being able to luff could stand into the
enemy's line. Rodney's flag-ship, the <i>Formidable</i>,
90, was just drawing up with the <i>Glorieux</i>, 74,
nineteenth from the van in the French order and
fourth astern of the <i>Ville de Paris</i>, De Grasse's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
flag-ship. Luffing to the new wind, she passed
through the French line at this point, followed
by the five ships astern of her; while the sixth
astern, the <i>Bedford</i>, 74, luffing on her own account,
broke also through the French astern of
the <i>C&eacute;sar</i> and the <i>Hector</i>, 74's, eleventh and
twelfth in their order. The twelve British vessels
in rear of the <i>Bedford</i> followed in her wake.
Hood was in one of these, the <i>Barfleur</i>, 90. Of
the ships ahead of Rodney the nearest one imitated
his example instantly and went through
the line; the remainder, sixteen in all, continued
northward for a space.</p>

<p>These sudden and unexpected movements overpowered
the <i>C&eacute;sar</i>, <i>Hector</i>, and <i>Glorieux</i> under a
weight of successive broadsides that completely
crushed them, separated De Grasse with six companion
vessels from his van and his rear, and
placed the British main body to windward of the
French. Both sides were disordered, but the
French were not only disordered but severed, into
three formless groups, not to be united except by
a good breeze and exceeding good management,
neither of which was forthcoming. Even to
frame a plan operative under such conditions requires
in an admiral accuracy of judgment and
readiness rarely bestowed; but to communicate
his designs and enforce execution upon captains
under such a staggering shock of disaster is even
more uncommon of accomplishment. During the
remainder of the day light airs from the eastward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
prevailed, interspersed with frequent calms; conditions
unfavorable to movement of any kind, but
far more to the French, deprived of concert of
purpose, than to the British, whose general course
was sufficiently defined by the confusion of the
enemy, and the accident of a small group surrounding
their commander-in-chief, to capture
whom was always a recognized principal object.
The very feebleness of the breeze favored them
by comparison; for they had but to go before
it with all their light sails, while their opponents,
in order to join, were constrained to lateral movement,
which did not allow the same canvas.</p>

<p>There was, in short, during the rest of the day
an unusual opportunity for success, on such a
scale as should be not only brilliant, but really
decisive of the future course of the war; opportunity
to inflict a maritime blow from which the
enemy could not recover. Does it need to say
clearly that here the choice was between a personal
triumph, already secured for the successful
admiral, and the general security of the nation
by the "annihilation"&mdash;the word is Nelson's&mdash;of
the enemy? That Rodney thus phrased the
alternative to himself is indeed most unlikely;
but that he failed to act efficiently, to rise to
an emergency, for the possible occurrence of
which he had had ample time as well as warning
to prepare, is but too certain. Even after the
British had got to windward of the enemy and
seen their disorder, although the signal for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
line was hauled down, none was made for a general
chase. That for close action, hoisted at 1
P.M., was discontinued thirty minutes later, when
five full hours of daylight remained. Even in
example the admiral was slack, by Hood's account.
"He pursued only under topsails (sometimes
his foresail set, and at other times his mizzen
topsail aback) the greatest part of the afternoon,
though the flying enemy had all the sail set
their very shattered state would allow." Hood,
curbed by his superior's immediate presence,
did what he could by putting all sail on the
<i>Barfleur</i>, and signalling the various ships of his
personal command to do the same; "not one but
chased in the afternoon with studding sails below
and aloft." It was bare poetic justice, therefore,
that the <i>Ville de Paris</i>, the great prize of the
day, though surrounded by numerous foes, struck
formally to him.</p>

<p>The <i>Hector</i>, <i>C&eacute;sar</i>, and <i>Glorieux</i>, already paralyzed
ere the chase began, were the only results
of this languid movement, except the French
flag-ship and the <i>Ardent</i>, 64. The latter was
taken because, notwithstanding her being an indifferent
sailer, she gallantly tried to pass from
her own division, the van, to support her commander-in-chief
in his extremity. It was 6.29 P.M.
when the <i>Ville de Paris</i> struck; sixteen minutes
later, 6.45, Rodney made signal to bring-to for
the night&mdash;to give over pursuit. Only the <i>Ville
de Paris</i> and the <i>Ardent</i> can be considered to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
have been secured by following, after the battle
proper closed.</p>

<p>Nor was any other attempt made to profit by
the victory. On the 13th the fleet began to
move very slowly towards Jamaica, the local protection
of which had become imperative through
the failure to annihilate the enemy, who must
now go to leeward&mdash;to Hayti; but after four
hours Rodney brought-to again, and on the 16th,
according to Hood, was in "the exact same spot
off Guadaloupe. It has indeed been calm some
part of the time, but we might have been more
than twenty leagues farther to the westward."
The <i>C&eacute;sar</i> having been accidentally burned on the
night of the battle, the prizes <i>Hector</i> and <i>Glorieux</i>
were sent ahead in charge of three ships-of-the-line.
This was a questionable disposition, as they
were advancing in the direction of the enemy,
without being covered by the interposition of
the main fleet. The <i>Ville de Paris</i> Rodney kept
close by his own side, unable to tear himself from
her; so at least said Hood, who "would to God
she had sunk the moment she had yielded to the
arms of His Majesty," for "we would then have
had a dozen better ships in lieu of her." Rodney
was so tickled with her that he "can talk of
nothing else, and says he will hoist his flag on
board of her."</p>

<p>On April 17th Hood, having vainly urged his
commander to improve the situation by more energetic
action, represented to him that the small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
detachment convoying the <i>Hector</i> and <i>Glorieux</i>
might fall in with a superior enemy, if not supported.
Rodney then directed him to go ahead
with ten ships until as far as Altavela, midway
on the south side of Santo Domingo, where he
was to await the main body. Hood gave a wide
construction to these orders, and pushed for the
Mona Passage, between Santo Domingo and
Porto Rico, where on the 19th he intercepted two
sixty-four gun ships, and two smaller cruisers. In
reporting this incident to Rodney, he added, "It
is a very mortifying circumstance to relate to
you, Sir, that the French fleet which you put to
flight on the 12th went through the Mona Channel
on the 18th, only the day before I was in it."
That sustained vigorous chase could not have
been fruitless is further shown by the fact that
Rodney himself, deliberately as he moved, apparently
lying-to each night of the first half-dozen
succeeding the battle, reached Jamaica three days
only after the main body of the defeated French
gained Cap Fran&ccedil;ois, though they had every
motive to speed.</p>

<p>Of the reasons for such lethargic action, wholly
inconsistent with true military principle, and bitterly
criticised by Hood,&mdash;who affirmed that
twenty ships might have been taken,&mdash;Rodney
drew up an express account, which cannot be
considered as adequate to his justification. In
this he argued that, if he had pursued, the enemy,
who "went off in a close connected body, might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
have defeated by rotation the ships that had
come up with them, and thereby exposed the
British fleet, after a victory, to a defeat." "They
went off in a body of twenty-six ships-of-the-line,
and might, by ordering two or three of their
best-sailing ships or frigates to have shown lights
at times, and by changing their course, have induced
the British fleet to have followed them,
while the main of their fleet, by hiding their
lights, might have hauled their wind, have been
far to windward before daylight, and intercepted
the captured ships, and the most crippled ships of
the English;" and he even conceived that, as the
main body of the British would at the same time
have gone far to leeward, the French, regaining
their own ports in Guadaloupe and Martinique,
might have taken Antigua, Barbados, and Santa
Lucia.</p>

<p>The principal impression produced by this formal
summary of reasons is that of unwisdom
after the event, and that it was elicited by the
remonstrances of Hood to himself, which are
known to have voiced discontent prevalent in
the fleet, and rendered some ready reply expedient.
The substance of them, when analyzed,
is that war must be rendered effective by not
running risks, and that calculation to that effect
is to be made by attributing every chance and
advantage to the enemy, and none to one's self.
Further, no account is to be taken of that most
notable factor, ultimate risk,&mdash;as distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
from present risk. This phantasm, of the sudden
assumption of the offensive by a beaten and disordered
fleet, which, through the capture of its
chief, had changed commanders at nightfall, is
as purely and mischievously imaginative as the
fiction, upon which it rests, of the close connected
body. Instead of being close-connected,
the French were scattered hopelessly, utterly
disabled for immediate, or even proximate, resistance
to a well sustained chase and attack.
During the next twenty-four hours their new admiral
had with him but ten ships; and only five
joined in the following twelve days, to April 25th,
when he reached Cap Fran&ccedil;ois, where four more
were found. Six others had strayed to Cura&ccedil;ao,
six hundred miles distant, whence they did not
rejoin the flag until May. Neither in Rodney's
surmises, nor in the actual facts of the case, is to
be found any reasonable excuse for failure to observe
the evident military duty of keeping touch
with the enemy during the dark hours,&mdash;"pursue
under easy sail," to use Hood's words, "so as
never to have lost sight of the enemy in the
night,"&mdash;with a view to resume the engagement
next day, at farthest. This, and to regain to
windward, were as feasible to the victor as to the
vanquished.</p>

<p>A truer explanation of this grave negligence is
to be found in Rodney's more casual words recorded
by Hood. "I lamented to Sir George on
the twelfth that the signal for a general chase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
was not made when that for the line was hauled
down, and that he did not continue to pursue so
as to keep sight of the enemy all night; to which
he only answered, 'Come, we have done very
handsomely as it is.' I could therefore say no
more upon the subject." He did, however, resume
the subject with Sir Charles Douglas, the
chief of staff. Douglas was of the same opinion
as Hood, and for making the suggestion at the
proper moment had been snubbed by Rodney,
who had established over him a domination of
manner which precluded proper insistence, or
even due representation, such as became his office.
"His answer was, 'Sir George chose to pursue in
a body;'" that is, in regular order, not by general
chase. "'Why, Sir Charles,' I replied, 'if that
was Sir George's wish, could it have been more
effectually complied with than by the signal for a
general chase, with <i>proper attention</i>? Because, if
a ship is too wide on the starboard wing, you
have a signal to make her steer more to port. If a
ship is too wide on the larboard wing, you have a
signal to make her steer more to starboard. If
a ship is too far ahead, you can by signal make
her shorten sail,'" etc. This by daylight; while,
"'if Sir George was unwilling his ships should engage
in the night, there is a signal to call every
ship in, and, that followed by the one for the
form of sailing, the fleet might have gone on in
sight of the enemy all night in the most compact
and safe order for completing the business most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
gloriously the next day.' Sir Charles walked off
without saying another word." There was in
fact nothing to say. Hood's methods were not
only correct, but in no respect novel. Every
capable officer was familiar with them before, as
well as after the battle. The trouble was that
Rodney was content with a present clear success,
and averse from further risk. He had reached
his limitations. It is known now that Douglas
agreed with Hood, but he was too loyal to his
chief to say so publicly, then or afterwards; and
especially, doubtless, to so irritable a talker.</p>

<p>As illustrative of Rodney's professional character
the events of April 8th to 12th are therefore
unfavorable rather than the reverse. Concerning
his stronger qualities their evidence is simply
cumulative; the new light thrown reveals defects,
not unsuspected excellencies. The readiness in
which his fleet was held at Santa Lucia, the
promptness with which he followed, the general
conduct of the chase as far as appears, though
doubtless open to criticism in detail as in the ever
censorious remarks of Hood,&mdash;all these show
the same alert, accomplished, and diligent officer,
resolute to the utmost of his natural and acquired
faculties. It is the same after the battle
joins, so long as its progress does not transcend
his accepted ideas,&mdash;which were much in advance
of the great mass of his contemporaries,&mdash;though
under the conditions he saw no chance to apply
the particular methods familiar to his thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>But when sudden opportunity offered, of a
kind he had not anticipated, he is found unequal
to it. Neither natural temper, nor acquired
habit of mind, respond to the call. To pass
through the French line, when the wind shifted,
was an instigation too sudden and a risk too
great for his own initiative. The balance of evidence
shows that it was due to the suggestion,
and even more to the pressure, of Sir Charles
Douglas. Carried beyond his habitual submission
by the impulse of a great thought, and unburdened
by the ultimate responsibility which must
remain with the admiral, the Captain of the Fleet
not only urged luffing through the enemy's line, but&mdash;so
the story runs&mdash;in the excitement of the
moment, and seeing the chance slipping past,
even under the then sluggish breeze, he ordered
the helm down. The admiral, thus faced, countermanded
the order. A moment of silence followed,
during which the two men stepped apart,
the admiral even entering the cabin, which would
be but a few paces from the wheel. Returning,
he permitted Douglas to have his way; an act
which, whether done courteously or grudgingly,
does not bespeak professional conviction, but
the simple acceptance of another's will in place
of one's own indecision.</p>

<p>The incident is in entire keeping with the
picture of Rodney's irresolution, and consequent
uncertain course, drawn in successive touches by
Hood in the hours and days succeeding the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
victory. Events had called him to deeds beyond
his limitations. Age of course counted for much;
fatigue, after three days of doubtful chase and
one of prolonged battle, for more; but it may
here be recalled that an older man, after a more
wearisome and doubtful exposure, willed of his
own motion to do what Rodney left undone.
Sir Byam Martin has recorded,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> "After the battle
of the 1st of June, Lord Howe was quite exhausted,
as well indeed he might, considering
that they had been manoeuvring and fighting for
three days. Although feeble in body, and so
exhausted as to be obliged to sit down in a chair
on deck, he expressed a wish to pursue the
flying enemy; but Sir Roger Curtis, the Captain
of the Fleet (Chief of Staff, as Douglas to
Rodney) said, 'I vow to God, my lord, if you
do they will turn the tables upon us.' This
anecdote I had from the late Admiral Bowen,
who was master of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> and a
party to the conversation." Under circumstances
approaching similarity,&mdash;so far as North Atlantic
fogs and weather resemble West India climate,&mdash;Howe
was sixty-eight, Rodney sixty-three, at
the moment of testing. The one lost the support
of the man&mdash;Curtis&mdash;upon whom he must
chiefly rely for observation and execution; the
other was urged in vain by the officer who held
the same relation to him. Nelson once spoke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>slightingly of "a Lord Howe's victory, take a
part, and retire into port;" as a trait of official
character, however, Howe's purpose was far in
advance of Rodney's, as this was viewed by
Nelson's ideal admiral, Hood. It is now known,
by a letter of Nelson's very recently published,
that he held the same opinion of Rodney's remissness
in this instance, although he cordially recognized
the general obligation of the country and
the navy to that eminent seaman. Writing in
1804 to his intimate friend Cornwallis, one of
Rodney's captains, he used these words: "On
the score of fighting, I believe, my dear friend,
that you have had your full share, and in obtaining
the greatest victory, <i>if it had been followed
up</i>, that our country ever saw."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It was a clear
case of spirit being brought into subjection to
form.</p>

<p>Rodney's professional career may be reckoned
to have ended with his arrival at Jamaica on the
29th of April. The change of ministry consequent
upon Cornwallis's surrender brought into
power his political opponents, and in May the
new Admiralty superseded him. News of the
victory reached England just too late to permit
them to revoke the order; his successor, Admiral
Pigot, having already sailed. On the 22d of
July Rodney left Jamaica, and on the 15th of
September landed at Bristol. Although not so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>intended, his recall may be considered in line
with his proverbial good fortune. He left his
successor to grapple with difficulties, and with
numbers, the continued existence of which was
due chiefly to his own neglect after April 12th,
and by the burden of which the conditions of
peace were influenced adversely to Great Britain.
To quote again Hood's apt comment, "Had Sir
George Rodney's judgment, after the enemy had
been so totally put to flight, bore any proportion
to the high courage, zeal and exertion, shown
by every captain, officer, and man under his command
in battle, <i>all</i> difficulty would now have
been at an end. We might have done just as we
pleased, instead of being at this hour (April 30th)
upon the defensive." This is ultimate risk,
which is entailed by exaggerated concern for
immediate apparent security, and ends in sapping
endurance.</p>

<p>The auspicious moment at which the news of
the battle reached England, and the surface
brilliancy of the achievement,&mdash;especially the
capture of the enemy's commander-in-chief,&mdash;diverted
attention from any examination of possible
shortcomings. Rodney received a vote of
thanks from Parliament, and was advanced to
the peerage by the King. A pension of &pound;2,000
per annum was also voted, additional doubtless
to a similar sum granted after his destruction
of Langara's squadron and relief of Gibraltar.
Other rewards and recognition had already at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>tended
his naval career. He had been made a
baronet in 1764, at the expiration of his first
tenure of the Leeward Islands Station; in 1780
the order of the Bath was bestowed upon him,&mdash;the
distinction being enhanced by not awaiting
a vacancy, but making him a supernumerary
member,&mdash;and in 1781, upon the death
of Lord Hawke, he became Vice-Admiral of Great
Britain, the highest professional honor in the
service.</p>

<p>After his return to England Rodney lived
generally in retirement. His latter years were
harassed by law suits, growing chiefly out of his
proceedings at St. Eustatius, and the attendant
expenses kept him poor. He died in May,
1792, at the age of seventy-three.</p>

<h2><a name="HOWE" id="HOWE"></a>HOWE</h2>

<h4>1726-1799</h4>

<p>The name of Howe, albeit that of a stranger
to the land, has a special claim upon the
esteem and cordial remembrance of Americans.
The elder brother of the subject of this sketch,
during the few short months in which he was
brought into close contact with the colonists of
1758, before the unlucky campaign of Ticonderoga,
won from them not merely the trust inspired
by his soldierly qualities and his genius for war,&mdash;the
genius of sound common sense and solidity
of character,&mdash;but got a deep hold upon their
affections by the consideration and respect shown
to them by him, traits to which they had been
too little accustomed in the British officers of
that day. Nor was this attitude on his part only
a superficial disguise assumed by policy to secure
a needed support. The shrewd, suspicious provincials
would soon have penetrated a veil so thin,
that covered only the usual supercilious arrogance
which they had heretofore encountered.
Lord Howe, almost alone among his military
contemporaries, warmly greeted them as fellow-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>countrymen,
men of no alien or degenerate blood.
He admitted at once the value of their experience,
sought their advice, and profited by both;
thus gaining, besides the material advantage of
methods adapted to the difficulties before him,
the adhesion of willing hearts that followed enthusiastically,
confident in their leader's wisdom,
and glowing with the unaccustomed sense of
being appreciated, of receiving recognition long
withheld, but now at last ungrudgingly accorded.
"The army felt him, from general to drummer
boy. He was its soul; and while breathing
into it his own energy and ardor, he broke
through the traditions of the service, and gave it
new shapes to suit the time and place.... He
made himself greatly beloved by the provincial
officers, and he did what he could to break down
the barriers between the colonial soldiers and the
British regulars."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In campaign, Lord Howe adopted the tried
expedients of forest warfare, associating with
himself its most practised exponents; and on
the morning of his death, in one of those petty
skirmishes which have cut short the career of so
many promising soldiers, he discussed the question
of Ticonderoga and its approaches, lying on
a bearskin beside the colonial ranger, John Stark,
to whose energy, nineteen years later, was due
the serious check that precipitated the ruin of
Burgoyne's expedition. Endeared as he was to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>American soldiers by the ties of mutual labors
and mutual perils gladly shared, and to all classes
by genial bearing and social accomplishments,
his untimely end was followed throughout the
Northern colonies by a spontaneous outburst of
sorrow, elicited not only by the anticipated failure
of the enterprise that hung upon his life, but
also by a sense of personal regret and loss. Massachusetts
perpetuated the memory of her grief
by a tablet in Westminster Abbey, which hands
down to our day "the affection her officers and
soldiers bore to his command."</p>

<p>Captain Richard Howe of the Royal Navy,
afterwards Admiral and Earl, succeeded him in
the Irish viscounty which had been bestowed
upon their grandfather by William III. Of a
temperament colder, at least in external manifestation,
than that of his brother, the new Lord
Howe was distinguished by the same fairness of
mind, and by an equanimity to which perturbation
and impulsive injustice were alike unknown.
There seems to have been in his bearing something
of that stern, impassive gravity that marked
Washington, and imposed a constraint upon bystanders;
but whatever apparent harshness there
was in the face only concealed a genuine warmth
of heart, which at times broke with an illumining
smile through the mask that covered it, and was
always ready to respond to the appeals of benevolence.
If, as an officer, he had a fault conspicuously
characteristic, it was a reluctance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
severity, a tendency to push indulgence to undue
extremes, into which may perhaps have entered
not merely leniency of disposition, but the weakness
of loving popularity. To be called by the
seamen, as Howe was, the "sailor's friend," is in
the experience of navies a suspicious encomium,
involving more of flattery to a man's foibles than
of credit to his discretion and his judgment. But
at the time when the quarrel between Great
Britain and her colonies was fast becoming imbittered,
the same kindliness, coupled with a calm
reasonableness of temper, ruled his feelings and
guided his action. Although by political creed
a moderate Tory, he had none of the wrong-headedness
of the party zealot; and the growing
alienation between those whom he, like his
brother, regarded as of one family, caused only
distress and an earnest desire to avert coming
evils. Influenced by these sentiments, he sought
the acquaintance of Franklin, then in London as
a commissioner from the colonies; and the interviews
between them, while resultless by reason
of the irreconcilable differences of opinion severing
the two parties to the dispute, convinced the
wary American of the good will and open-mindedness
of the already distinguished British seaman.
The same qualities doubtless suggested the selection
of Howe for the mission of conciliation to
America, in 1776, where his associate was his
younger brother, Sir William, in whom the
family virtues had, by exaggeration, degenerated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
into an indolent good humor fatal to his military
efficiency. The admiral, on the contrary, was
not more remarkable for amiability and resolute
personal courage than he was for sustained energy
and untiring attention to duty,&mdash;traits which
assured adequate naval direction, in case conciliation
should give place, as it did, to coercive
measures.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the methods, or the
opportunities, of naval biographers and historians
of the past century have preserved to us little,
in personal detail and anecdote, of a period the
peculiarities of which, if not exactly picturesque,
were at least grotesque and amusing. The
humor of Smollett has indeed drawn in broad
caricature some of the salient features of the seaman
of his day, which was that of Howe's entrance
into the navy; and those who are familiar with
the naval light literature based upon the times of
Nelson can recognize in it characteristics so similar,
though evidently softened by advancing civilization
and increased contact with the world, as
to vouch for the accuracy of the general impression
conveyed by the earlier novelist. It is, however,
correct only as a <i>general</i> impression, in which,
too, allowance must be made for the animus of
an author who had grievances to exploit, and
whose great aim was to amuse, even if exact
truthfulness were sacrificed at the shrine of exaggerated
portrayal. Though not wholly without
occasional gleams of light, shed here and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
by recorded incident and anecdote upon the
strange life of the seamen of that period, the
early personal experiences of individuals have
had scant commemoration; and with the exception
of St. Vincent, who fortunately had a garrulous
biographer, we learn little of men like
Hawke, Howe, Hood, and Keppel, until, already
possessors of naval rank, they stand forth as
actors in events rather historical than biographical.</p>

<p>Of Howe's first services, therefore, not much
record remains except a bare summary of dates,&mdash;of
promotions, and of ships to which he was
attached,&mdash;until 1755, the beginning of the Seven
Years War, when he was already a post-captain.
Born in 1726, he entered the navy in 1739, at the
outbreak of the war with Spain which initiated a
forty years' struggle over colonies and colonial
trade. With short intervals of peace, this contest
was the prominent characteristic of the middle
of the eighteenth century, and terminated in
the conquest of Canada, the independence of the
United States, and the establishment of British
predominance in India and upon the ocean. This
rupture of a quiet that had then endured a quarter
of a century was so popular with the awakened
intelligence of England, aroused at last to
the imminent importance of her call to expansion
by sea, that it was greeted by a general pealing
of the bells, which drew from the reluctant prime
minister, Walpole, that bitter gibe, "Ay, to-day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
they are ringing their bells, and to-morrow they
will be wringing their hands." Howe embarked
with Anson's squadron, celebrated for its sufferings,
its persistence, and its achievements, to
waste the Spanish colonies of the Pacific; but
the ship in which he had started was so racked
in the attempt to double Cape Horn that she was
forced to return to England. The young officer
afterwards served actively in the West Indies and
in home waters. On the 1st of May, 1746, being
then in command of a small sloop of war, he
was severely wounded in action with a superior
enemy's force off the coast of Scotland. A few
days before that, on the 10th of April, he had
been promoted post-captain, being barely turned
twenty. Thus early he was securely placed on
the road to the highest honors of his profession,
which, however, were not to prove beyond
the just claim of his already established personal
merit.</p>

<p>During the first thirty months of the Seven
Years War, Howe was closely engaged with,
and at times in command of, the naval part of
combined expeditions of the army and navy,
fitted out to harass the French coasts. The
chief, though not the sole aim in these undertakings
was to effect diversions in favor of
Frederick the Great, then plunged in his desperate
struggle with the allied forces of Russia, Austria,
and France. It was believed that the last
would be compelled, for the defence of her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
shores against those raids,&mdash;desultory, it is true
but yet uncertain as to the time and place where
the attack would fall,&mdash;to withdraw a number of
troops that would sensibly reduce the great odds
then overbearing the Prussian king. It is more
than doubtful whether this direction of British
power, in partial, eccentric efforts, produced results
adequate to the means employed. In immediate
injury to France they certainly failed,
and it is questionable whether they materially
helped Frederick; but they made a brisk stir in
the Channel ports, their operations were within
easy reach of England in a day when news travelled
slowly, and they drew the attention of the
public and of London society in a degree wholly
disproportionate to their importance relatively to
the great issues of the war. Their failures, which
exceeded their achievements, caused general scandal;
and their occasional triumphs aroused exaggerated
satisfaction at this earlier period, before
the round of unbroken successes under the first
Pitt had accustomed men, to use Walpole's lively
phrase, to come to breakfast with the question,
"What new victory is there this morning?"
The brilliant letter-writer's correspondence is full
of the gossip arising from these usually paltry
affairs; and throughout, whether in success or
disaster, the name of Howe appears frequently,
and always as the subject of praise. "Howe,
brother of the lord of that name, was the third
on the naval list. He was undaunted as a rock,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and as silent, the characteristics of his whole
race. He and Wolfe soon contracted a friendship
like the union of cannon and gunpowder."
"Howe," he says in another place, "never made
a friendship except at the mouth of a cannon."</p>

<p>Of his professional merits, however, professional
opinions will be more convincing. A Frenchman,
who had acted as pilot of his ship, the <i>Magnanime</i>,
when going into action, was asked if it were
possible to take a lighter vessel, the <i>Burford</i>,
close to the walls of another fort farther in.
"Yes," he replied, "but I should prefer to take
the <i>Magnanime</i>." "But why?" it was rejoined;
"for the <i>Burford</i> draws less water." "True," he
said, "<i>mais le capitaine Howe est jeune et brave</i>."
Sir Edward Hawke, the most distinguished admiral
of that generation, gave a yet higher commendation
to the "young and brave" captain,
who at this time served under his orders,&mdash;one
that must cause a sigh of regretful desire to
many a troubled superior. Several years later,
when First Lord of the Admiralty, he nominated
Howe, in October, 1770, to command a squadron
destined to the Mediterranean, when hostilities
with Spain were expected. The appointment was
criticised on the ground that he was a junior
admiral in the fleet, having been very recently
promoted; but Hawke, doubtless mindful that
the same objection had been made to him at a
similar period of his career, answered, in the spirit
of St. Vincent defending his choice of Nelson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
"I have tried Lord Howe on most important
occasions. He never asked me <i>how</i> he was to
execute any service entrusted to his charge, but
always went straight forward and <i>did it</i>." Some
quaint instances are recorded of the taciturnity
for which he was also noted. Amid the recriminations
that followed the failure at Rochefort,
Howe neither wrote nor said anything. At last
the Admiralty asked why he had not expressed
an opinion. In the somewhat ponderous style
that marked his utterances, he replied, "With
regard to the operations of the troops I was
silent, as not being at that time well enough
informed thereof, and to avoid the mention of
any particulars that might prove not exactly
agreeable to the truth." The next year, an army
officer of rank, putting questions to him and
receiving no answer, said, "Mr. Howe, don't you
hear me? I have asked you several questions."
Howe answered curtly, "I don't like questions,"&mdash;in
which he was perhaps not peculiar.</p>

<p>It was during the continuance of these petty
descents upon the French coast, in 1758, that
Howe was directed to receive on board, as midshipman,
and for service in the fleet, the Duke
of York, a grandson of the reigning monarch; in
connection with whom arose a saying that was
long current, perhaps is still current, in the British
navy. The young lad of nineteen, before
beginning his routine duties, held a reception on
board Commodore Howe's ship, at which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
captains of the squadron were presented to him.
The seamen, unpractised in ceremonial distinctions
other than naval, saw with wonder that the
midshipman kept on his hat, while the rest uncovered.
"The young gentleman," whispered
one, "isn't over civil, as I thinks. Look if he
don't keep his hat on before all the captains!"
"Why," another was heard to reply, "where
should he learn manners, seeing as how he was
never at sea before?"</p>

<p>It is likewise from this period of Howe's career
that two of the rare personal anecdotes have
been transmitted, illustrative of his coolness and
self-possession under all circumstances of danger,
as well as when under the enemy's fire; one of
them also touched with a bit of humor,&mdash;not a
usual characteristic of his self-contained reticence.
The service involved considerable danger, being
close in with the enemy's coast, which was indifferently
well known and subject to heavy gales
of wind blowing dead on shore. On one such
occasion his ship had anchored with two anchors
ahead, and he had retired to his cabin, when the
officer of the watch hurriedly entered, saying,
"My lord, the anchors are coming home,"&mdash;the
common sea expression for their failure to grip
the bottom, whereupon the ship of course drags
toward the beach. "Coming home, are they?"
rejoined Howe. "I am sure they are very right.
I don't know who would stay abroad on such a
night, if he could help it." Yet another time he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
was roused from sleep by a lieutenant in evident
perturbation: "My lord, the ship is on fire close
to the magazine; but don't be frightened; we
shall get it under shortly." "Frightened, sir!"
said Howe. "What do you mean? I never was
frightened in my life." Then, looking the unlucky
officer in the face, he continued, "Pray,
Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, how does a man <i>feel</i> when he is frightened?
I need not ask how he <i>looks</i>."</p>

<p>The even, unaffected self-possession indicated
by these anecdotes of the early prime of life
remained with him to the end, as is shown by
another incident collected by a biographer who
knew many of his contemporaries. "When
Howe was in command of the Channel Fleet,
after a dark and boisterous night, in which the
ships had been in some danger of running foul of
each other, Lord Gardner, then the third in command,
the next day went on board the <i>Queen
Charlotte</i> and inquired of Lord Howe how he
had slept, for that he himself had not been able
to get any rest from anxiety of mind. Lord
Howe said he had slept perfectly well, for as he
had taken every possible precaution he could
before dark, he laid himself down with a conscious
feeling that everything had been done,
which it was in his power to do, for the safety
of the ships, and the lives of those intrusted to
his care, and this conviction set his mind at ease."
The apprehensiveness with which Gardner was
afflicted "is further exemplified by an anecdote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
told by Admiral Sir James Whitshed, who commanded
the <i>Alligator</i>, next him in the line.
Such was his anxiety, even in ordinary weather,
that, though each ship carried three poop lanterns,
he always kept one burning in his cabin,
and when he thought the <i>Alligator</i> was approaching
too near he used to run out into the stern
gallery with the lantern in his hand, waving it
so as to be noticed." From Gardner's rank at
the time, the conversation narrated must have
occurred during the early years of the French
Revolution, when Howe was over sixty-seven.
As illustrative of character it is particularly
interesting, for Gardner was not only a much
younger man, but one whose gallantry and competence
had been eminently proved as a captain
in several hard fought battles, while as an admiral
in chief command he later acquired considerable
reputation as a tactician.</p>

<p>Composure under suspense is chiefly a matter
of temperament; of the constitutional outfit with
which Nature favors some, and does not others.
It may be cultivated by its happy possessor; but
when wanting, the sufferer can supply its place
only by laborious self-control, the tension of which
by itself expends the energies it seeks to maintain,
and so imposes limitations of strength that
are often insuperable obstacles to achievement,
especially if prolonged. The strain of this endurance
is prominent among those borne by commanders-in-chief,
who can at no moment afford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
to be lax, nor yet precipitate; and it increases
with time at compound interest. Howe's native
imperturbability was therefore one of the chief
factors in his great professional powers, making
possible the full exercise of all the others. By
dint of it principally he reached the eminence
which must be attributed to him as a general
officer; for it underlay the full, continuous, and
sustained play of the very marked faculties, personal
and professional, natural and acquired,
which he had. It insured that they should be
fully developed, and should not flag; for it
preserved his full command over them by delivering
him from the factitious burdens of the
imagination.</p>

<p>This quality not only entered into his external
professional life, but characterized the habitual
temper of his mind. "He divested himself in a
remarkable manner," says his biographer, "of
every approach to a state of anger or resentment"&mdash;instancing
herein, it may be noted, the improvement
of a natural gift; "and he carefully abstained
from all irritating language, whether in speaking
or writing. In the perusal of the four hundred
letters and upwards that have been mentioned,
embracing opinions of, and unreserved discussions
upon, the merits or otherwise of many and
various characters, of all classes of individuals,
it did not fail forcibly to strike the reader of them,
how invariably, with one single exception, he
takes the good natured and favorable side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
every question. In the whole series, the harshest
word employed is 'blockhead,' bestowed on his
steward for not taking care of his <i>own</i> interests."</p>

<p>This equable frame of mind was thus a fundamental
trait in Howe, private as well as public,
personal as well as professional; not assumed for
the moment, but constant in operation. He had
none of the irritability attributed to genius, as
also he gives no sign of its inspiration,&mdash;of
originality. He is seen at his strongest in dealing
stage by stage with difficult situations created
for him, following step by step, and step by step
checking, the lead of another; his action being
elicited by successive circumstances, not deriving
from some creative, far-reaching conception of his
own. The temperament is one eminently practical,
capable on due opportunity of very great
deeds, as Howe showed; for, having improved
much native capacity by the constant cultivation
of professional knowledge, and with the self-confidence
which naturally springs from such acquisition,
he rose readily to the level of exertion
demanded by any emergency not in excess of his
abilities, and so long as the need lasted maintained
himself there easily, without consciousness
of exhaustive effort, or apprehension of improbable
contingencies. "Never hasting, never resting,"
might be safely affirmed of him.</p>

<p>He is seen therefore at his best in a defensive
campaign, such as that against D'Estaing in the
summer of 1778, which in the writer's opinion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
was his greatest achievement; or again in a great
deliberate operation like the relief of Gibraltar,&mdash;the
one of his deeds most esteemed, it is said,
by himself,&mdash;protracted over a month in its performance,
and essentially defensive in character,
not only because of the much superior fleet of
the enemies, but because the adverse forces of
nature and the obstinate incapacity of the captains
of supply ships had to be counteracted by
unremitting watchfulness, foresight, and skill,
dealing however with conditions determined for
him, not imposed by his own initiative; or, finally,
in the chase and partial actions of May 28 and
29, 1794, in which persistence, endurance, and
aptitude are alike and equally displayed, assuring
to him beyond dispute the credit of a great tactician.
Accordingly, in direct consequence of
what has been noted, it is as a tactician, and not
as a strategist, that he can claim rank; for whatever
may be the fundamental identity of principles
in the military art, whether applied to strategy
or to tactics, it in the end remains true that the
tactician deals with circumstances immediately
before him and essentially transient, while the
strategist has to take wider views of more lasting
conditions, and into them to introduce his own
conceptions to be modifying factors. Creative
thought and faculty of initiation are therefore
more characteristic of the natural endowments of
the born strategist. There is also more room for
them in his work, because in the larger and more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
complicated field there is greater elasticity and
opportunity to effect new combinations, to contrive
which makes a greater call upon originative
power.</p>

<p>In the chain of eminent typical names which
leads up to that of Nelson, there will be found
between Howe and his next conspicuous successor,&mdash;conspicuous,
that is, not only by merit, as
was Hood, but by achievement, which was denied
to Hood,&mdash;between Howe and Jervis, just that
difference which essentially separates the tactician
from the strategist: the lifting of the eye
from the moves of the game immediately before
one, to glance over the whole board, to view the
wider field, and from its possibilities to form conceptions
directive of immediate action for distant
ends. In both these distinguished general officers,&mdash;for
such both were,&mdash;there is seen a
similar close attention to details, based upon and
guided by an acquaintance with their profession
profound as well as extensive, minute as well as
general; in both the same diligence and iron
equanimity in difficult situations, although in
Jervis the impression received is rather that of a
burden borne with resolute fortitude, whereas in
Howe the burden is thrown off by a placid, unforeboding
temper; but in the adoption of measures,
those of Howe will be found generally not to
extend beyond the situation immediately before
him, by which they are dictated, whereas Jervis
seeks to bend circumstances to his will, according<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
to a conception he has formed of what the situation
ought to be, and can be forced to become.</p>

<p>The idiosyncrasy of either officer is emphasized
in their respective plans of campaign, while commanding
the Channel Fleet during the French
Revolution. Howe will maintain a certain station
in port, keeping his fleet there in hand,
well conditioned, and as far as may be well
drilled; then, when the French do something, he
also will do something to counteract them. Jervis,
on the contrary, confronting substantially the
same conditions, frames his measures with a view
to prevent the enemy from doing anything, and
all the details of his plan rest upon this one idea,
to the fulfilment of which they contribute. He
puts the fleet at once into the position of action,
instead of that of awaiting, as Howe does. Both
are charged with the same duty,&mdash;the defence of
Great Britain,&mdash;and by the same Government,
which evidently in each case frames its instructions
upon the ascertained views of the eminent
officer intrusted with the work. To carry out
this defensive campaign, Howe of his own choice
narrows his strategic plan to the sheer defensive,
which follows the initiative of the enemy; Jervis
of set purpose seeks the same object by offensive
dispositions, by which the enemy is to be forced
to regulate his movements. Howe sees the defence
of the empire in the preservation of his
own fleet; Jervis in the destruction of the enemy.
The one view is local, narrow, and negative; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
other general, broad, and positive. As often happens&mdash;and
very naturally&mdash;Jervis's preoccupation
with considerations wider than his own command
found expression, twice at least, in phrases
which pithily summed up his steadfast enduring
habit of mind. On the morning of St. Vincent
he was overheard to mutter, "A victory is very
necessary to England at this time." The present
odds to his own fleet, twenty-seven against fifteen,
disappeared in the larger needs of the country.
Again, when wrestling with the perplexities and
exigencies of the wild Brest blockade in midwinter,
in January, 1801, he wrote concerning
repairs to his own vessels, "Under the present
impending storm from the north of Europe, and
the necessity there is of equipping every ship in
the royal ports that can swim, no ship under my
command must have anything done to her at Plymouth
or Portsmouth that can be done at this
anchorage,"&mdash;at Torbay, an open though partially
sheltered roadstead. Here again is seen the subordination
of the particular and personal care to
the broad considerations of a great strategic
emergency.</p>

<p>The series of diversions upon the French coast
in which Howe was employed during 1758, terminated
with that season, and he returned to his
own ship, the <i>Magnanime</i>, rejoining with her the
main fleet under Hawke in the great Brest blockade
of 1759. The French Government, after four
years of disaster upon the continent, of naval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
humiliation, and of loss of maritime and colonial
power, had now realized that its worst evils and
chief danger sprang from the sea power of Great
Britain, and, like Napoleon a half-century later,
determined to attempt an invasion. Its preparations
and Hawke's dispositions to counteract
them, have been described in the life of that
admiral, as have Rodney's bombardment of Havre
and interception of coastwise communications;
all directed to the same general end of confounding
designs against England, but no longer as
mere diversions in favor of Frederick. Howe
was still a private captain, but he bore a characteristically
conspicuous part in the stormy final
scene at Quiberon, when Hawke drove Conflans
before him to utter confusion. When the French
fleet was sighted, the <i>Magnanime</i> had been sent
ahead to make the land. She was thus in the
lead in the headlong chase which ensued, and was
among the first in action; at 3 P.M., by Howe's
journal, the firing having begun at 2.30, according
to Hawke's despatch. The foreyard being soon
shot away, the consequent loss of manoeuvring
power impeded her captain's designs in placing
her, but she remained closely engaged throughout,
compelling one French vessel to strike and anchor
alongside her. The bad weather prevented taking
possession that night of the prize, which, in
consequence, availed herself of her liberty by
running ashore, and so was lost to her captors.
The <i>Magnanime</i> was reported as having thirteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
killed and sixty-six wounded, out of a total of
hurt not much exceeding three hundred in the
entire fleet. The casualty list proves exposure to
fire, doubtless; but is no sure test of the effectiveness
of a vessel's action. The certainty of Howe's
conduct in this affair, otherwise imperfectly described,
rests on a broader and firmer basis of
reputation, won by unvarying efficiency in many
differing capacities and circumstances.</p>

<p>He continued to serve, but without further
noteworthy incident, up to the peace made in the
winter of 1762-63. From that time until the
difficulties with the American colonies came to
a head in 1775, he was not actively employed
afloat, although continuously engaged upon professional
matters, especially as a close student of
naval tactics and its kindred subjects, to which
he always gave sympathetic attention. During
this period, also, he became a member of the
House of Commons, and so continued until transferred
from the Irish peerage to that of Great
Britain, in 1782. In 1770, at the age of forty-five,
he became a rear-admiral, and, as has been
already stated, received at once a proof of
Hawke's high confidence, by being appointed to
the command of the squadron destined for the
Mediterranean, when hostilities concerning the
Falkland Islands threatened with Spain; a dispute
chiefly memorable as the means of bringing
into the navy both Nelson and Exmouth. In
1775 he was promoted to vice-admiral, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
February of the following year was appointed
commander-in-chief of the North American station.
Together with his military duties, he was,
as has before been said, given powers, conjointly
with his brother, to treat for the settlement of
existing troubles.</p>

<p>Although his habitual reticence restrained his
sentiments from finding expression in positive
words, there can be little doubt that the necessity
of raising his hand against the Americans caused
Howe keener regret than it did to many of his
brother officers. He took instant occasion to
address to Franklin a personal note, recalling
their former association, and expressing an earnest
hope that their friendship might contribute
something to insure the success of his official
mission. In the five years that had elapsed, however,
Franklin had been in the heat of the political
struggle, and, philosopher though he was,
he had not Howe's natural phlegm. Hence, his
reply, while marked by respect and even formal
cordiality toward the admiral himself, displayed a
vivacity of resentment and a bitterness for which
the latter had scarcely looked. Still, his habitual
equanimity was not ruffled, and he read the letter
with the simple comment, "My old friend expresses
himself very warmly."</p>

<p>Howe's arrival antedated the signature of the
Declaration of Independence by less than a
week. During the period of attempted negotiation,
while scrupulously faithful to his instructions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
he showed to his late fellow-countrymen all the
courtesy and consideration that the most cordial
esteem could extend. The incident of the
official communication addressed by the Howes
to Washington, in which they sought to evade
giving him the title of "General," is sufficiently
familiar; but it is more rarely recalled that, in
verbal intercourse with American officers, the
admiral habitually styled him "General Washington,"
and sent complimentary messages to
him as such. He even spoke of the colonies as
"states," and at the same time dwelt with evident
emotion upon the testimonials of respect and
affection which had been shown to his brother's
memory by the colonists.</p>

<p>To narrate Howe's share in the operations by
which New York in 1776, and Philadelphia in
1777, fell into the hands of the British, would be
only to repeat well-known historical episodes,
enlivened by few or no incidents personal to
himself. In them the navy played a part at once
subordinate and indispensable, as is the office of
a foundation to its superstructure. The cause
of the Americans was hopeless as long as their
waters remained in the undisputed control of the
enemy's ships; and it was the attempt of Great
Britain to cast aside this essential support, and
to rely upon the army alone in a wild and intricate
country, that led to her first great disaster,&mdash;Burgoyne's
surrender at Saratoga. Upon this,
France at once recognized the independence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the colonies, and their alliance with that kingdom
followed. A French fleet of twelve ships-of-the-line
under the Count D'Estaing, left Toulon
April 15, 1778, for the American coast. This
force far exceeded Howe's; and it was no thanks
to the British Government, but only to the admiral's
sleepless vigilance and activity, seconded,
as such qualities are apt to be, by at least an
average degree of supineness on the part of his
antagonist, that his scanty squadron was not
surprised and overpowered in Delaware Bay,
when Sir Henry Clinton evacuated Philadelphia
to retreat upon New York. Howe, who
had the defects of his qualities, whose deliberate
and almost stolid exterior evinced a phlegmatic
composure of spirit which required the spur of
imminent emergency to rouse it into vehement
action, never in his long career appeared to
greater advantage, nor achieved military results
more truly brilliant, than at this time, and up to
the abandonment of the attack on Rhode Island
by the Americans under Sullivan, three months
later. Then only, if ever, did he rise above the
level of an accomplished and resolute general
officer, and establish a claim to genius, of that
order, however, which is not originative in character,
but signalized by an infinite capacity for
taking pains; and that not for a short time
merely, but through a long, protracted period of
strain. The display, nevertheless, does not assure
him a place in the front rank of great com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>manders,
whose actions find their source in the
living impulse of their own creative energy; for
it is elicited by extreme circumstances alone,
by obvious pressure, to which he must adapt
himself. This he does with unfailing adequacy,
indeed; resolutely checkmating, but never initiating.
Steady as a rock, like a rock, also, Howe
only gave forth sparks under blows that would
have broken weaker men.</p>

<p>D'Estaing was twelve weeks in coming from
Toulon to Cape May, but Howe knew nothing of
his sailing until three weeks after he had started.
Then orders were received to abandon Philadelphia
and concentrate upon New York, The
naval forces were scattered, and had to be collected;
the supplies of the army, except those
needed for the march across Jersey, were to be
embarked at Philadelphia, and the great train of
transports and ships of war moved over a hundred
miles down a difficult river, and thence to New
York. Despite every effort, a loss of ten days
was incurred, through calms, in the mere transit
from Philadelphia to the sea; but during this
momentous crisis D'Estaing did not appear.
Two days more sufficed to bring the fleet into
New York Bay on June 29th; but yet the grave
admiral, roused to the full tension of his great
abilities, rested not. With a force little more
than half that coming against him, he knew that
all depended upon the rapidity with which his
squadron took the imposing position he had in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
mind. Still D'Estaing tarried, giving to his untiring
enemy twelve more precious days, during
which the army of Sir Henry Clinton, reaching
Navesink beach the day after the fleet, was
snatched by it from the hot pursuit of the disappointed
Washington, and carried safely to New
York.</p>

<p>In the expected French squadron were eight
ships of seventy-four guns or over, with three
sixty-fours. To confront these, for the defence
of the port, Howe disposed of six, none heavier
than a sixty-four; but they were ranged to command
the entrance of the harbor upon a tactical
plan that evinced both a careful study of the
ground and the resources of a thorough seaman.
This instance alone, had Howe never done anything
else, would have established his reputation
as a tactician. The ships, placed in &eacute;chelon,
and enabled to turn their batteries in any direction,
by the provision of springs and adaptation
to the tide conditions at the moment when
alone attack would be possible, could concentrate
their entire force of guns upon the enemy, raking
them as they advanced up channel; while, if
they succeeded in coming abreast, then also the
broadsides would be turned upon them. When
D'Estaing at last came, all was ready; the energy
that had improved every fleeting moment
then gave place to the imperturbable resolution
which was Howe's greatest attribute, and against
which, seconded by his careful preparation, suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>cess
could be won only by a desperate and sanguinary
struggle. The attempt was not made.
Ten days after arriving, the French admiral again
put to sea, heading to the southward. By combined
energy and skill Howe had won the first
move in the game. Clinton's army and New
York were saved.</p>

<p>"The arrival of the French fleet," wrote Washington
a little later, "is a great and striking event;
but the operations of it have been injured by a
number of unforeseen and unfavorable circumstances,
which have lessened the importance of
its services to a great degree. The length of the
passage, in the first instance, was a capital misfortune;
for, had even one of common length
taken place, Lord Howe, with the British ships
of war and all the transports in the river Delaware,
must inevitably have fallen; and Sir Henry
Clinton must have had better luck than is commonly
dispensed to men of his profession under
such circumstances, if he and his troops had not
shared at least the fate of Burgoyne." If this
narration of events is so carefully worded as not
to imply a censure upon D'Estaing, it none the
less, however unintentionally, measures the great
military merit of Lord Howe.</p>

<p>Nor did this end his achievements. Two or
three days after the French departed a small
reinforcement from England reached New York,
and in the course of a week Howe, who had not
failed to keep touch with the enemy's fleet till it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
was ninety miles at sea, heard that it had been
seen again, heading for Narragansett Bay, then
controlled by a British garrison on Rhode Island.
This was in pursuance of a prearranged plan to
support the American forces under General Sullivan,
which had already advanced against the
place. Adapting anew his action to the circumstances
of the enemy's movements, Howe, though
still much inferior, hurried to the spot, arriving
and anchoring off Point Judith, at the entrance
to Newport, on August 9th, the day after
D'Estaing had run the fire of the British works
and entered the harbor. With correct strategic
judgment, with a flash of insight which did not
usually distinguish him when an enemy was not
in view, and contrary to his avowed policy when
commander of the Channel Fleet, he saw that the
true position for his squadron was in face of the
hostile port, ready to act as circumstances might
dictate. His mere presence blocked this operation
also. D'Estaing, either fearing that the
British admiral might take the offensive and gain
some unexpected advantage, or tempted by the
apparent opportunity of crushing a small hostile
division, put to sea the next day. Howe, far superior
as a seaman to his antagonist, manoeuvred
to avoid a battle with a force superior by a half
to his own; and this purpose was effected by his
skilful management of his fleet, aided by his adversary's
irresolution, notwithstanding that the
unusual action of the wind thwarted his effort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
to control the situation by gaining the weather
gage. Both the general manoeuvres, and the
special dispositions made of his ships to meet
the successive intentions of the enemy, as they
became apparent, showed a mind fortified by previous
preparation as well as by the natural self-possession
for which he was conspicuous. It was
eminently a tactical triumph.</p>

<p>A tremendous gale followed, scattered both
fleets, and dismasted several of the French.
D'Estaing appeared again off Rhode Island only
to notify Sullivan that he could no longer aid
him; and the latter, deprived of an indispensable
support, withdrew in confusion. The disappointment
of the Americans showed itself by
mobbing some French seamen in Boston, whither
their fleet retired. "After the enterprise upon
Rhode Island had been planned," continues Washington,
in the letter above quoted, "and was in
the moment of execution, that Lord Howe with
the British ships should interpose merely to create
a diversion, and draw the French fleet from
the island, was again unlucky, as the Count had
not returned on the 17th to the island, though
drawn from it on the 10th; by which the whole
was subjected to a miscarriage." What Washington
politicly calls bad luck was French bad
management, provoked and baffled by Howe's accurate
strategy, untiring energy, consummate seamanship,
and tactical proficiency. Clinton's army
delivered, the forcing of New York frustrated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Rhode Island and its garrison saved, by a squadron
never more than two thirds of that opposed
to it, were achievements to illustrate any career;
and the more so that they were effected by sheer
scientific fencing, like some of Bonaparte's greatest
feats, with little loss of blood. They form
Howe's highest title to fame, and his only claim
as a strategist. It will be observed, however,
that the characteristic of his course throughout is
untiring and adequate adaption to the exigencies
of the situation, as momentarily determined by
the opponent's movements. There is in it no
single original step. Such, indeed, is commonly
the case with a strictly defensive campaign by a
decisively inferior force. It is only the rare men
who solve such difficulties by unexpected exceptional
action.</p>

<p>It is indicative of Howe's personal feelings
about the colonial quarrel, during the two years
in which he thus ably discharged his official
duties, that both he and his brother determined
to ask relief from their commands as soon as it
appeared that all hopes of conciliation were over.
The appointment of other commissioners hastened
their decision, and the permission to return
was already in the admiral's hands when the
news of D'Estaing's coming was received. Fighting
a traditional foreign foe was a different thing
from shedding the blood of men between whom
and himself there was so much in common; nor
was Howe the man to dodge responsibility by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
turning over an inferior force, threatened by such
heavy odds, to a junior officer before the new commander-in-chief
came. His resolution to remain
was as happy for his renown as it was creditable
to his character. After the brief campaign just
sketched, true to his steady previous policy, he
followed the French fleet to Newport when he
heard of its reappearance there, and thence to
Boston, coming off that port only three days after
it; but finding it now sheltered under shore batteries,
impregnable to his still inferior numbers,
and learning that it was in need of extensive
repairs, he resigned the command in New York
to a rear-admiral, and departed to Newport to meet
his successor, Vice-Admiral Byron. Upon the
latter's arrival he sailed for England, towards the
end of September, 1778. General Howe had
preceded him by four months.</p>

<p>The two brothers went home with feelings
of great resentment against the ministry. The
course of the war had so far been unfortunate.
The loss of Boston, the surrender of Burgoyne,
the evacuation of Philadelphia, and finally the
entrance of France into the contest, constituted a
combination of mishaps which certainly implied
fault somewhere. As usual, no one was willing
to accept blame, and hot disputes, with injurious
imputations, raged in Parliament. There is here,
happily, no necessity for apportioning the responsibility,
except in the case of Lord Howe;
and as to him, it is reasonably clear that all was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
done that could be up to the coming of the
French, while it is incontestable that afterwards,
with a force utterly inadequate, for which the
Government was answerable, he had averted imminent
disaster by most masterly management.
His words in the House of Commons were bitter.
"He had been deceived into his command, and
he was deceived while he retained it. Tired and
disgusted, he had desired permission to resign it;
and he would have returned as soon as he obtained
leave, but he could not think of doing so while a
superior enemy remained in American seas; that,
as soon as that impediment was removed, he
gladly embraced the first opportunity of returning
to Europe. Such, and the recollection of
what he had suffered, were his motives for resigning
the command, and such for declining any
future service so long as the present ministry
remained in office."</p>

<p>In terms like these could officers holding seats
in Parliament speak concerning the Government
of the day. It was a period in which not only
did party feeling run high, but corruption was an
almost avowed method of political management.
The navy itself was split into factions by political
bias and personal jealousies, and there was a saying
that "if a naval officer were to be roasted,
another officer could always be found to turn the
spit." The head of the Admiralty, Lord Sandwich,
was a man of much ability, but also of
profligate character, as well public as private. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
doubtless wished the success of his department,&mdash;under
the terrible chances of war no chief can
do otherwise, for the responsibility of failure must
fall upon his own head; but through corrupt
administration the strength of the navy, upon the
outbreak of war, had been unequal to the work it
had to do. Some one must suffer for this remissness,
and who more naturally than the commander
of a distant station, who confessed himself "no
politician"? Hence, Howe certainly thought,
the neglect with which he had been treated. "It
would not be prudent to trust the little reputation
he had earned by forty years' service, his personal
honor and everything else he held dear, in the
hands of men who have neither the ability to act
on their own judgment, nor the integrity and
good sense to follow the advice of others who
might know more of the matter." A year later,
it was roundly charged that the Channel Fleet had
been brought home at a most critical moment,
losing an exceptional opportunity for striking the
enemy, in order to affect the elections in a dockyard
town. Admiral Keppel considered that he
had been sacrificed to party feeling; and a very
distinguished officer, Barrington, refused to take
a fleet, although willing to serve as second, even
under a junior. "Who," he wrote, "would trust
himself in chief command with such a set of
scoundrels as are now in office?" Even a quarter
of a century later, Earl St. Vincent gave to
George III. himself the same reason for declin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>ing
employment. After eliciting from him an
unfavorable opinion as to the discipline and efficiency
of the Channel Fleet, the king asked,
"Where such evils exist, does Lord St. Vincent
feel justified in refusing his conspicuous ability
to remedy them?" "My life," replied the old
seaman, "is at your Majesty's disposal, and at
that of my country; but my honour is in my own
keeping, and I will not expose myself to the risk
of losing it by the machinations of this ministry,
under which I should hold command." To such
feelings it was due that Howe, Keppel, and Barrington
did not go to sea during the anxious
three years that followed the return of the first.
The illustrious Rodney, their only rival, but in
himself a host, was the one distinguished naval
chief who belonged heart and soul to the party
with which Sandwich was identified.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Rodney's period of
activity during the war of the American Revolution
coincided substantially with that of Howe's
retirement. The same change of administration,
in the spring of 1782, that led to the recall of the
older man, brought Howe again into service, to
replace the mediocrities who for three campaigns
had commanded the Channel Fleet, the mainstay
of Great Britain's safety. Upon it depended not
only the protection of the British Islands and of
the trade routes converging upon them, but also
the occasional revictualling of Gibraltar, now
undergoing the third year of the famous siege.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Its operations extended to the North Sea, where
the Dutch, now hostile, flanked the road to the
Baltic, whence came the naval stores essential to
the efficiency of the British fleet; to the Bay of
Biscay, intercepting the convoys despatched from
France to her navies abroad; and to the Chops
of the Channel, where focussed the trade routes
from East and West, and where more than once
heavy losses had been inflicted upon British
commerce by the allies. All these services
received conspicuous and successful illustration
during Howe's brief command, at the hands
either of the commander-in-chief or of his subordinates,
among whom were the very distinguished
Barrington and Kempenfelt. Howe
himself, with twenty-five sail-of-the-line, in July
encountered an allied fleet of forty off Scilly.
By an adroit tactical movement, very characteristic
of his resolute and adequate presence of
mind, he carried his ships between Scilly and
Land's End by night, disappearing before morning
from the enemy's view. He thus succeeded
in meeting to the westward a valuable Jamaica
convoy, homeward bound, and taking it under
his protection. The allies being afterwards
driven south by a heavy gale, the vessels of war
and trade slipped by and reached England safely.
Thus does good luck often give its blessing to
good management.</p>

<p>To relieve Gibraltar, however, was the one
really great task, commensurate to his abilities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
that devolved upon Howe during this short command.
In the summer of 1782, the Spaniards
were completing ten heavy floating batteries, expected
to be impervious to shot and to combustion,
and from an attack by which upon the sea
front of the works decisive results were anticipated.
At the same time prolonged blockade by
land and sea, supported by forty-nine allied ships-of-the-line
anchored at Algeciras, the Spanish
port on the opposite side of the Bay, was producing
its inevitable results, and the place was now
in the last extremity for provisions and munitions
of war. To oppose the hostile fleets and
introduce the essential succors, to carry which
required thirty-one sail of supply ships, Great
Britain could muster only thirty-four of-the-line,
but to them were adjoined the superb professional
abilities of Lord Howe, never fully evoked except
when in sight of an enemy, as he here must act,
with Barrington and Kempenfelt as seconds; the
one the pattern of the practical, experienced,
division commander, tested on many occasions,
the other an officer much of Howe's own stamp,
and like him a diligent student and promoter of
naval manoeuvres and naval signals, to the development
of which both had greatly contributed.
To the train of supply ships were added for convoy
a number of merchant vessels destined to
different parts of the world, so that the grand
total which finally sailed on September 11th was
183. While this great body was gathering at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Spithead, there occurred the celebrated incident
of the oversetting of the <i>Royal George</i> at her
anchors, on August 29th,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When Kempenfelt went down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With twice four hundred men."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Howe thus lost the man upon whom principally
he must have relied for the more purely tactical
development of the fleet, opportunity for
which he anticipated in the necessarily slow and
graduated progress of so large an assemblage.</p>

<p>The occasion was indeed one that called for
deliberation as well as for calculated audacity,
both controlled by a composure and ability rarely
conjoined to the same great extent as in Howe.
Circumstances were more imminent than in the
two previous reliefs by Rodney and Darby; for
the greatly superior numbers of the allies were
now not in Cadiz, as before, but lying only four
miles from the anchorage which the supply vessels
must gain. True, certainly, that for these a
certain portion of their path would be shielded by
the guns of the fortress, but a much greater part
would be wholly out of their range; and the
mere question of reaching his berth, a navigational
problem complicated by uncertain winds,
and by a very certain current sweeping in from
the Atlantic, was extremely difficult for the merchant
skipper of the day, a seaman rough and
ready, but not always either skilful or heedful.
The problem before Howe demanded therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the utmost of his seamanlike qualities and of his
tactical capacity.</p>

<p>The length of the passage speaks for the deliberate
caution of Howe's management, as his conduct
at the critical moment of approach, and
during the yet more critical interval of accomplishing
the entrance of the supply ships, evinces
the cool and masterful self-control which always
assured the complete and sustained exertion
of his great professional powers at a required
instant. Thirty days were consumed in the voyage
from Spithead to Gibraltar, but no transport
was dropped. Of the huge convoy even, it is
narrated that after a heavy gale, just before reaching
Cape Finisterre, the full tally of 183 was
counted. After passing that cape, the traders
probably parted for their several destinations,
each body under a suitable escort. The stoppages
for the rounding-up of straying or laggard vessels,
or for re-establishing the observance of order
which ever contributes to regulated movement,
and through it to success, were not in this case
time lost. The admiral made of them opportunities
for exercising his ships-of-the-line in the
new system of signals, and in the simple evolutions
depending upon them, which underlie flexibility
of action, and in the day of battle enable
the fleet to respond to the purposes of its commander
with reasonable precision, and in mutual
support.</p>

<p>Such drill was doubly necessary, for it not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
familiarized the intelligence of the captains with
ideas too generally neglected by seamen until
called upon to put them into practice, and
revealed to them difficulties not realized until
encountered, but also enforced recognition of
the particular qualities of each vessel, upon the
due observance of which substantial accuracy of
manoeuvre depends. The experience gained during
this cruise, going and returning, probably
opened the eyes of many officers to unsuspected
deficiencies in themselves, in handling a ship
under the exigencies of fleet tactics. Howe certainly
was in this respect disappointed in his followers,
but probably not greatly surprised. At
the same time it is but fair to note that the
service was performed throughout without any
marked hitch traceable to want of general professional
ability. A French writer has commented
upon this. "There occurred none of
those events, so frequent in the experiences of
a squadron, which often oblige admirals to take
a course wholly contrary to the end they have
in view. It is impossible not to recall the
unhappy incidents which, from the 9th to the
12th of April, of this same year, befell the
squadron of the Count De Grasse. If it is just
to admit that Lord Howe displayed the highest
talent, it should be added that he had in his
hands excellent instruments."</p>

<p>On the 10th of October the fleet and storeships
drew nigh the Straits of Gibraltar. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
that day it was rejoined by a frigate, which
forty-eight hours before had been sent ahead to
communicate the approach of the relief, and to
concert action. She brought the cheering news
of the victorious repulse by the British of the
grand attack by sea and land upon September
13th, with the entire destruction of the trusted
floating batteries. Under this flush of national
triumph, and with a fair westerly wind, the great
expedition entered the straits on October 11th,
in ranged order for action. The convoy went
first, because, sailing before the wind, it was thus
to leeward of the ships of war, in position to be
immediately defended, if attacked. Two squadrons
of the fleet succeeded them, in line-of-battle
ahead, formed thus for instant engagement, Howe
leading in the <i>Victory</i>; while the third of the
squadrons followed in reserve, in an order not
stated, but probably in a line abreast, sweeping
a broader belt of sea, and more nearly under the
eye of the Commander-in-chief, who, for the purposes
of the present operation, had left his traditional
post in the centre. Howe's reasons for
this change of position, if ever stated, have not
come under the eyes of the writer; but analysis
shows that he was there close to the storeships,
whose safe entrance to the port was at once the
main object of the enterprise and the one most
critically uncertain of achievement, because of
the general bad behavior of convoys. There he
could control them more surely, and at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
time by his own conduct indicate his general
purposes to subordinates, who, however deficient
in distinctly tactical proficiency, had the seamanship
and the willingness adequately to support
him.</p>

<p>At 6 P.M. the supply ships were off the mouth
of the bay, with the wind fair for their anchorage;
but, although full and particular instructions
had been issued to them concerning currents
and other local conditions, all save four
missed the entrance and were swept to the eastward
of the Rock. The fleet of course had to
follow its charge, and by their failure a new task
confronted Howe's professional abilities and endurance.
Fortunately he had an able adviser in
the captain of the fleet, who had had long experience
of the locality, invaluable during the trying
week that ensued. The allies had not yet stirred.
To move near fifty sail-of-the-line in pursuit of an
enemy, inferior indeed, but ranged for battle, and
the precise moment of whose appearance could
not have been foreseen, was no slight undertaking,
as Nelson afterwards said. It may be
recalled that before Trafalgar over twenty-four
hours were needed for the allied thirty-three to
get out of Cadiz Bay. On the 13th, however,
the combined French and Spaniards sailed, intent
primarily, it would seem, not on the true and
vital offensive purpose of frustrating the relief,
but upon the very secondary defensive object of
preserving two of their own numbers, which in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
a recent gale had been swept to the eastward.
Thus trivially preoccupied, they practically neglected
Howe, who on his part stripped for action
by sending the supply vessels to the Zaffarine
Islands, where the vagarious instincts of their
captains would be controlled by an anchor on
the bottom. On the 14th the allies bore north
from the British, close under the Spanish coast,
and visible only from the mastheads. On the
15th the wind came east, and the convoy and
fleet began cautiously to move towards Gibraltar,
the enemy apparently out of sight, and certainly
to the eastward. On the evening of the 16th
eighteen supply ships were at the mole, and on
the 18th all had arrived. Gibraltar was equipped
for another year's endurance.</p>

<p>We have less than could be wished of particulars
touching this performance of Howe's, from
the day of leaving England to that of fulfilment,
five full weeks later. Inference and comment has
to be built up upon incidents transmitted disconnectedly,
interpreted in connection with the
usual known conditions and the relative strength
of the two opposing parties. To professional
understanding, thus far supplemented, much is
clear; quite enough, at the least, to avouch the
deliberation, the steadiness, the professional aptitude,
the unremitting exertion that so well supplies
the place of celerity,&mdash;never resting, if
never hasting,&mdash;the calculated daring at fit
moments, and above all the unfailing self-posses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>sion
and self-reliance which at every instant up to
the last secured to the British enterprise the full
value of the other qualities possessed by the Commander-in-chief.
A biographical notice of Howe
cannot be complete without quoting the tribute
of an accomplished officer belonging to one of the
navies then arrayed against him. "The qualities
displayed by Lord Howe during this short campaign,"
says Captain Chevalier of the French
service, "rose to the full height of the mission
which he had to fulfil. This operation, one of
the finest in the War of American Independence,
merits a praise equal to that of a victory. If the
English fleet was favored by circumstances,&mdash;and
it is rare that in such enterprises one can succeed
without the aid of fortune,&mdash;it was above all the
Commander-in-chief's quickness of perception, the
accuracy of his judgment, and the rapidity of his
decisions that assured success."</p>

<p>Having accomplished his main object and
landed besides fifteen hundred barrels of powder
from his own ships, Howe tarried no longer.
Like Nelson, at Gibraltar on his way to St. Vincent,
he would not trifle with an easterly wind,
without which he could not leave the Straits
against the constant inset; neither would he adventure
action, against a force superior by a third,
amid the currents that had caused him so trying
an experience. There was, moreover, the important
strategic consideration that if the allied
fleets, which were again in sight, followed him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
out, they would thereby be drawn from any possible
molestation of the unloading of the supply
ships, which had been attempted, though with
no great success, on the occasion of the relief
by Darby, in 1781. Howe therefore at once
headed for the Atlantic. The allies pursued,
and engaged partially on the afternoon and evening
of October 20th; but the attack was not
pushed home, although they had the advantage of
the wind and of numbers. On the 14th of November
the British fleet regained Spithead. It may
be remarked that Admirals Barrington and Millbank
both praised their captains very highly, for
the maintenance of the order in their respective
divisions during this action; the former saying
it "was the finest close connected line I ever
saw during my service at sea." Howe, who held
higher ideals, conceived through earnest and prolonged
study and reflection, was less well satisfied.
It seems, however, reasonable to infer that
the assiduity of his efforts to promote tactical
precision had realized at least a partial measure
of success.</p>

<p>Another long term of shore life now intervened,
carrying the gallant admiral over the change-fraught
years of failing powers from fifty-six to
sixty-seven, at which age he was again called into
service, in the course of which he was to perform
the most celebrated, but, it may confidently be
affirmed, not the most substantial, nor even the
most brilliant, action of his career. During<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
much of this intermediate period, between 1783
and 1788, Howe occupied the Cabinet position
of First Lord of the Admiralty, the civil head
and administrator of the Navy. Into the discharge
of this office he carried the same qualities
of assiduous attention to duty, and of close
devotion to details of professional progress, which
characterized him when afloat; but, while far
from devoid of importance, there is but little in
this part of his story that needs mention as
distinctive. Perhaps the most interesting incidents,
seen in the light of afterwards, are that
one of his earliest appointments to a ship was
given to Nelson; and that the cordiality of his
reception at the end of the cruise is said to
have removed from the hero an incipient but
very strong disgust for the service. "You ask
me," wrote the future admiral to his brother,
"by what interest did I get a ship? I answer,
having served with credit was my recommendation
to Lord Howe. Anything in reason that I
can ask, I am sure of obtaining from his justice."</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the French Revolution,
Howe stood conspicuously at the head of the
navy, distinguished at once for well-known professional
accomplishments and for tried capacity
in chief command. His rivals in renown among
his contemporaries&mdash;Keppel, Barrington, and
Rodney&mdash;had gone to their rest. Jervis, Duncan,
Nelson, Collingwood, and their compeers,
had yet to show what was in them as general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
officers. Lord Hood alone remained; and he,
although he had done deeds of great promise,
had come to the front too late in the previous
war for his reputation to rest upon sustained
achievement as well as upon hopeful indication.
The great commands were given to these two:
Hood, the junior, going to the Mediterranean with
twenty ships-of-the-line, Howe taking the Channel
Fleet of somewhat superior numbers.</p>

<p>The solid, deliberate, methodical qualities of
the veteran admiral were better adapted to the
more purely defensive r&ocirc;le, forced upon Great
Britain by the allied superiority in 1782, than to
the continuous, vigilant, aggressive action demanded
by the new conditions with which he
now had to deal, when the great conflagration of
the Revolution was to be hemmed in and stamped
out by the unyielding pressure and massive blows
of the British sea power. The days of regulated,
routine hostilities between rulers had passed
away with the uprising of a people; the time
foretold, when nation should rise against nation,
was suddenly come with the crash of an ancient
kingdom and of its social order. An admirable
organizer and indefatigable driller of ships, though
apparently a poor disciplinarian, Howe lacked
the breadth of view, the clear intuitions, the
alacrity of mind, brought to bear upon the problem
by Jervis and Nelson, who, thus inspired, framed
the sagacious plan to which, more than to any
other one cause, was due the exhaustion alike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
of the Revolutionary fury and of Napoleon's imperial
power. Keenly interested in the material
efficiency of his ships, as well as in the precision
with which they could perform necessary evolutions
and maintain prescribed formations, he
sought to attain these ends by long stays in port,
varied by formal cruises devoted to secondary
objects and to fleet tactics. For these reasons also
he steadfastly refused to countenance the system of
close-watching the enemy's ports, by the presence
before each of a British force adequate to check
each movement at its beginning.</p>

<p>Thus nursing ships and men, Howe flattered
himself he should insure the perfection of the instrument
which should be his stay in the hour of
battle. Herein he ignored the fundamental truth,
plainly perceived by his successor, St. Vincent, that
the effectiveness of a military instrument consists
more in the method of its use, and in the practised
skill of the human element that wields it, than in
the material perfection of the weapon itself. It
may justly be urged on his behalf that the preparation
he sought should have been made, but was not,
by the Government in the long years of peace.
This is true; but yet the fact remains that he
pursued his system by choice and conviction
repeatedly affirmed; that continuous instead of
occasional cruising in the proper positions would
better have reached the ends of drill; and that to
the material well being of his ships he sacrificed
those correct military dispositions before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
enemy's ports, instituted and maintained by
Hawke, and further developed and extended by
Jervis, who at the same time preserved the efficiency
of the vessels by increased energy and
careful prevision of their wants. The brilliant
victory of the 1st of June has obscured the
accompanying fact, that lamentable failure characterized
the general strategic use of the Channel
Fleet under Howe and his immediate successor.</p>

<p>Once in sight of the enemy, however, the old
man regained the fire of youth, and showed the
attainments which long study and careful thought
had added to his natural talent for war, enabling
him to introduce distinct advances upon the tactical
conceptions of his predecessors. The battle
of June 1, 1794, was brought about in the following
manner. Political anarchy and a bad season
had combined to ruin the French harvests in
1793, and actual famine threatened the land.
To obviate this, at least partially, the Government
had bought in the United States a large quantity
of breadstuffs, which were expected to arrive in
May or June, borne by one hundred and eighty
merchant vessels. To insure the safety of this
valuable convoy, the Brest Fleet was sent to meet
it at a designated point; five ships going first,
and twenty-five following a few days later. Robespierre's
orders to the admiral, Villaret-Joyeuse,
were to avoid battle, if possible, but at all hazards
to secure the merchant fleet, or his head would
answer for it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>About the same time, Howe, who had kept his
vessels in port during the winter, sailed from the
Channel with thirty-two ships-of-the-line. These
he soon divided into two squadrons; one of which,
numbering six, after performing a specific service,
was not ordered to rejoin the main body, but to
cruise in a different spot. These ships were sadly
missed on the day of battle, when they could have
changed a brilliant into a crushing victory. Howe
himself went to seek the French, instead of taking
a position where they must pass; and after
some running to and fro, in which the British
actually got to the westward of their foes, and
might well have missed them altogether, he was
lucky enough, on the 28th of May, some four
hundred miles west of the island of Ushant, to
find the larger of their two detachments. This
having been meanwhile joined by one ship
from the smaller, both opponents now numbered
twenty-six heavy vessels.</p>

<p>The French were to windward, a position
which gives the power of refusing or delaying
decisive action. The average speed of any fleet,
however, must fall below the best of some of the
force opposed to it; and Howe, wishing to compel
battle, sent out six of his fastest and handiest
ships. These were directed to concentrate their
fire upon the enemy's rear, which, from the point
of view of naval tactics, was the weakest part
of a line-of-battle of sailing ships; because, to
aid it, vessels ahead must turn round and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
change their formation, performing a regular
evolution, whereas, if the van be assailed, the
rear naturally advances to its help. If this partial
attack crippled one or more of the French, the
disabled ships would drift towards the British,
where either they would be captured, or their comrades
would be obliged to come to their rescue,
hazarding the general engagement that Howe
wanted. As it happened, the French had in the
rear an immense ship of one hundred and ten
guns, which beat off in detail the successive
attacks of her smaller antagonists; but in so
doing she received so much injury that she left
the fleet after nightfall, passing the British unmolested,
and went back to Brest. One of her
assailants, also, had to return to England; but,
as the relative force of the units thus clipped
from the respective opponents was as three to two,
the general result was a distinct material gain for
Howe. It is to be scored to his credit as a tactician
that he let this single enemy go, rather than
scatter his fleet and lose ground in trying to take
her. He had a more important object.</p>

<p>The next morning, May 29th, the French by
poor seamanship had lost to leeward, and were
consequently somewhat nearer. Both fleets were
heading southeasterly, with the wind at south-southwest;
both, consequently, on the starboard
tack. Howe saw that, by tacking in succession,
his column would so head that several of his vessels
in passing could bring the hostile rear under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
their guns, and that it was even possible that
three or four might be cut off, unless reinforced;
to attempt which by the enemy would involve
also tactical possibilities favorable to the British.
The necessary movement was ordered; and
the French admiral, seeing things in the same
light, was justly so alarmed for the result that he
turned his head ships, and after them his whole
column in succession, to run down to help the
rear. Judicious, and indeed necessary, as this
was, it played right into Howe's hands, and was
a tribute to his tactical skill, by which it was
compelled; for in doing this the French necessarily
gave up much of their distance to windward,
and so hastened the collision they wished
to avoid. Although the attack upon their rear
was limited to a few desultory broadsides, the
two fleets were at last nearly within cannon shot,
whereas the day before they had been eight or
ten miles apart. Both were now on the port tack,
running west in parallel lines.</p>

<p>Towards noon, Howe saw that the morning's
opportunity of directing his whole column upon
the enemy's rear again offered, but with a far
better chance; that if his ships manoeuvred well
half a dozen of the French must be cut off, unless
their admiral, to save them, repeated his previous
manoeuvre of running down to their assistance,
which would infallibly entail the general engagement
sought by the British. The signal to tack
in succession was again made, and to pass through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the enemy's line; but here Howe's purpose was
foiled, as Rodney's on April 17th, by the failure of
his leading vessel. Her captain, like Carkett,
was of considerable seniority, having commanded
a ship-of-the-line under Howe at New York, in
1778. His conduct during this brief campaign
was so unfavorably noticed by his admiral that
he asked a Court-Martial, which dismissed him
from his ship, though clearing him of cowardice.
Upon the present occasion he for some time
delayed obedience; and, when he did go about,
wore instead of tacking, which lost ground and
caused confusion by going to leeward. The
second ship acted well, and struck the French
column some distance from its rear, proving
Howe right in judging that the enemy's order
could there be pierced. As this vessel was not
closely supported, she received such injuries
from successive fires, that, when she at last
found an opening through which to pass, she was
unable to manoeuvre.</p>

<p>Seeing that the van was failing him, Howe,
whose flag-ship, the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, was tenth
from the head of his column, now took the lead
himself, tacked his own vessel, though her turn
was not yet come, and, accompanied by his next
ahead and astern,&mdash;another striking instance of
the inspiring influence of a high example,&mdash;stood
straight for the hostile order. The three
broke through astern of the sixth ship from the
French rear, and cut off two of the enemy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
which were speedily surrounded by others of
the British. Villaret-Joyeuse then repeated his
former evolution, and nothing could have saved a
general engagement except the disorder into which
the British had fallen, and Howe's methodical
abhorrence of attacks made in such confusion as
prevailed. Moreover, the decisive result of this
last brush was that the French entirely lost the
windward position, and the British admiral knew
that he now had them where they could not
escape; he could afford to postpone the issue.
Accordingly, fighting ceased for the day; but
the French had been so mauled that three more
ships had to go into port, leaving them but
twenty-two to the enemy's twenty-five.</p>

<p>To appreciate Howe's personal merit as a
tactician, reflection should be bestowed upon the
particulars of his conduct on these two days,
with which the First of June is not to be compared;
for in them culminated, so to speak, a
long course of preparation in the study of tactical
possibilities, and of the system of signals needed
to insure necessary evolutions. His officers, as
a body, do not appear to have deserved by their
manoeuvring the encomium passed by Rodney
upon his, during the long chase to windward in
May, 1780; and, as Howe had now held command
for a year, this failure may probably be
assigned to lack of that punctilious severity to
which Rodney attributed his own success. But
in the matter of personal acquirement Howe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
shows a distinct advance upon Rodney's ideas
and methods. There is not to be noted in
Rodney's actions any foreshadowing of the judicious
attack upon the enemy's rear, on May 28th,
by a smart flying squadron. This doubtless presents
some analogy to a general chase, but there
is in it more of system and of regulated action;
in short, there is development. Again, although
Rodney doubtless tacked in succession repeatedly,
between May 9th and May 20th, in his efforts to
reach the enemy to windward, there does not
then appear, nor did there appear on either of
the two occasions when he succeeded in striking
their column from to leeward, any intention, such
as Howe on the 29th communicated by signal
and enforced by action, of breaking through the
enemy's line even at the cost of breaking his
own. Not even on April 12th had Rodney, as far
as appears, any such formulated plan. There is
here, therefore, distinct progress, in the nature of
reflective and reasoned development; for it is
scarcely to be supposed that Howe's assiduity
and close contact with the navy had failed to
note, for future application, the incidents of
Rodney's battles, which had been the subject
of animated discussion and censure by eye-witnesses.</p>

<p>It will be recognized that the conception in
Howe's mind, maintained unchangeably and
carried consistently into effect during these two
days, was to attack continually, as opportunity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
offered, the rear end of the enemy's column, which
corresponds precisely with the attack upon the
flank of a line of battle on shore. Merit does
not depend upon result, but fortunate result
should be noted for the encouragement and
guidance of the future. In consequence of these
sustained and judiciously directed movements,
and of the steps found necessary by the French
admiral because of injuries received, the enemy
had lost from their line four ships, of which one
was of one hundred and twenty guns, another of
eighty; while of those retained one had lost all her
spars save the lower masts, and had thenceforth
to be towed in action. Against this was to be
set only one British seventy-four, disabled on the
28th and returned to port; their other damaged
vessels refitted at sea and stayed with the fleet.
On the other hand, Howe's separated division of
six remained separated, whereas four fresh French
ships joined their main fleet on the 30th. Admirable
tactics were thus neutralized by defective
strategy; and therefore it may with substantial
accuracy be said that Howe's professional qualities
and defects were both signally illustrated in this,
his last conspicuous service.</p>

<p>The French admiral on the evening of the
29th saw that he now must fight, and at a disadvantage;
consequently, he could not hope to
protect the convoy. As to save this was his
prime object, the next best thing was to entice
the British out of its path. With this view he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
stood away to the northwest; while a dense fog
coming on both favored his design and prevented
further encounter during the two ensuing days,
throughout which Howe continued to pursue.
In the evening of May 31st the weather cleared,
and at daybreak the next morning the enemies
were in position, ready for battle, two long
columns of ships, heading west, the British twenty-five,
the French again twenty-six through the
junction of the four vessels mentioned. Howe
now had cause to regret his absent six, and to
ponder Nelson's wise saying, "Only numbers
can annihilate."</p>

<p>The time for manoeuvring was past. Able
tactician as he personally was, and admirable as
had been the direction of his efforts in the two
days' fighting, Howe had been forced in them to
realize two things, namely, that his captains were,
singly, superior in seamanship, and their crews
in gunnery, to the French; and again, that in
the ability to work together as a fleet the British
were so deficient as to promise very imperfect results,
if he attempted any but the simplest formation.
To such, therefore, he resorted; falling back
upon the old, unskilful, sledge-hammer fashion
of the British navy. Arranging his ships in one
long line, three miles from the enemy, he made
them all go down together, each to attack a specified
opponent, coming into action as nearly as
might be at the same instant. Thus the French,
from the individual inferiority of the units of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
their fleet, would be at all points overpowered.
The issue justified the forecast; but the manner
of performance was curiously and happily marked
by Howe's own peculiar phlegm. There was
a long summer day ahead for fighting, and no
need for hurry. The order was first accurately
formed, and canvas reduced to proper proportions.
Then the crews went to breakfast. After
breakfast, the ships all headed for the hostile line,
under short sail, the admiral keeping them in
hand during the approach, as an infantry officer
dresses his company. Hence the shock from end
to end was so nearly simultaneous as to induce
success unequalled in any engagement conducted
on the same primitive plan.</p>

<p>Picturesque as well as sublime, animating as
well as solemn, on that bright Sunday morning,
was this prelude to the stern game of war about
to be played: the quiet summer sea stirred only
by a breeze sufficient to cap with white the little
waves that ruffled its surface; the dark hulls
gently rippling the water aside in their slow advance,
a ridge of foam curling on either side of
the furrow ploughed by them in their onward way;
their massive sides broken by two, or at times
three, rows of ports, whence, the tompions drawn,
yawned the sullen lines of guns, behind which, unseen,
but easily realized by the instructed eye,
clustered the groups of ready seamen who served
each piece. Aloft swung leisurely to and fro the
tall spars, which ordinarily, in so light a wind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
would be clad in canvas from deck to truck,
but whose naked trimness now proclaimed the
deadly purpose of that still approach. Upon the
high poops, where floated the standard of either
nation, gathered round each chief the little knot
of officers through whom commands were issued
and reports received, the nerves along which
thrilled the impulses of the great organism, from
its head, the admiral, through every member to
the dark lowest decks, nearly awash, where, as
farthest from the captain's own oversight, the
senior lieutenants controlled the action of the
ships' heaviest batteries.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, Lord Howe,
whose burden of sixty-eight years had for four
days found no rest save what he could snatch in
an arm-chair, now, at the prospect of battle, "displayed
an animation," writes an eye-witness, "of
which, at his age, and after such fatigue of body
and mind, I had not thought him capable. He
seemed to contemplate the result as one of unbounded
satisfaction." By his side stood his
fleet-captain, Curtis, of whose service among the
floating batteries, and during the siege of Gibraltar,
the governor of the fortress had said, "He
is the man to whom the king is chiefly indebted
for its security;" and Codrington, then a lieutenant,
who afterwards commanded the allied fleets at
Navarino. Five ships to the left, Collingwood,
in the <i>Barfleur</i>, was making to the admiral whose
flag she bore the remark that stirred Thackeray:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
"Our wives are now about going to church,
but we will ring about these Frenchmen's ears a
peal which will drown their bells." The French
officers, both admirals and captains, were mainly
unknown men, alike then and thereafter. The
fierce flames of the Revolution had swept away
the men of the old school, mostly aristocrats,
and time had not yet brought forward the very
few who during the Napoleonic period showed
marked capacity. The commander-in-chief, Villaret-Joyeuse,
had three years before been a lieutenant.
He had a high record for gallantry, but
was without antecedents as a general officer.
With him, on the poop of the <i>Montagne</i>, which
took her name from Robespierre's political supporters,
stood that anomalous companion of the
generals and admirals of the day, the Revolutionary
commissioner, Jean Bon Saint-Andr&eacute;, about
to learn by experience the practical working of
the system he had advocated, to disregard all tests
of ability save patriotism and courage, depreciating
practice and skill as unnecessary to the valor
of the true Frenchman.</p>

<p>As the British line drew near the French,
Howe said to Curtis, "Prepare the signal for
close action." "There is no such signal," replied
Curtis. "No," said the admiral, "but there is
one for closer action, and I only want that to be
made in case of captains not doing their duty."
Then closing a little signal book he always carried,
he continued to those around him, "Now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
gentlemen, no more book, no more signals. I
look to you to do the duty of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>
in engaging the flag-ship. I don't want the
ships to be bilge to bilge, but if you can lock the
yardarms, so much the better; the battle will be
the quicker decided." His purpose was to go
through the French line, and fight the <i>Montagne</i>
on the far side. Some doubted their succeeding,
but Howe overbore them. "That's right,
my lord!" cried Bowen, the sailing-master, who
looked to the ship's steering. "The <i>Charlotte</i>
will make room for herself." She pushed close
under the French ship's stern, grazing her ensign,
and raking her from stern to stem with a withering
fire, beneath which fell three hundred men.
A length or two beyond lay the French <i>Jacobin</i>.
Howe ordered the <i>Charlotte</i> to luff, and place
herself between the two. "If we do," said Bowen,
"we shall be on board one of them." "What is
that to you, sir?" asked Howe quickly. "Oh!"
muttered the master, not inaudibly. "D&mdash;&mdash;n my
eyes if I care, if you don't. I'll go near enough
to singe some of our whiskers." And then, seeing
by the <i>Jacobins</i> rudder that she was going
off, he brought the <i>Charlotte</i> sharp round, her jib
boom grazing the second Frenchman as her side
had grazed the flag of the first.</p>

<p>From this moment the battle raged furiously
from end to end of the field for nearly an hour,&mdash;a
wild scene of smoke and confusion, under
cover of which many a fierce ship duel was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
fought, while here and there men wandered, lost,
in a maze of bewilderment that neutralized their
better judgment. An English naval captain tells
a service tradition of one who was so busy watching
the compass, to keep his position in the ranks,
that he lost sight of his antagonist, and never
again found him. Many a quaint incident passed,
recorded or unrecorded, under that sulphurous
canopy. A British ship, wholly dismasted, lay
between two enemies, her captain desperately
wounded. A murmur of surrender was somewhere
heard; but as the first lieutenant checked
it with firm authority, a cock flew upon the stump
of a mast and crowed lustily. The exultant note
found quick response in hearts not given to
despair, and a burst of merriment, accompanied
with three cheers, replied to the bird's triumphant
scream. On board the <i>Brunswick</i>, in her struggle
with the <i>Vengeur</i>, one of the longest and fiercest
fights the sea has ever seen, the cocked hat was
shot off the effigy of the Duke of Brunswick,
which she bore as a figure-head. A deputation
from the crew gravely requested the captain to
allow the use of his spare chapeau, which was
securely nailed on, and protected his grace's wig
during the rest of the action. After this battle
with the ships of the new republic, the partisans
of monarchy noted with satisfaction that, among
the many royal figures that surmounted the stems
of the British fleet, not one lost his crown. Of a
harum-scarum Irish captain are told two droll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
stories. After being hotly engaged for some time
with a French ship, the fire of the latter slackened,
and then ceased. He called to know if she had
surrendered. The reply was, "No." "Then,"
shouted he, "d&mdash;&mdash;n you, why don't you fire?"
Having disposed of his special antagonist without
losing his own spars, the same man kept along in
search of new adventures, until he came to a
British ship totally dismasted and otherwise
badly damaged. She was commanded by a captain
of rigidly devout piety. "Well, Jemmy,"
hailed the Irishman, "you are pretty well mauled;
but never mind, Jemmy, whom the Lord loveth
he chasteneth."</p>

<p>The French have transmitted to us less of
anecdote, nor is it easy to connect the thought of
humor with those grimly earnest republicans
and the days of the Terror. There is, indeed,
something unintentionally funny in the remark
of the commander of one of the captured ships to
his captors. They had, it was true, dismasted
half the French fleet, and had taken over a fourth;
yet he assured them it could not be considered a
victory, "but merely a butchery, in which the
British had shown neither science nor tactics."
The one story, noble and enduring, that will ever
be associated with the French on the 1st of June
is in full keeping with the temper of the times
and the enthusiasm of the nation. The seventy-four-gun
ship <i>Vengeur</i>, after a three hours' fight,
yardarm to yardarm, with the British <i>Brunswick</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
was left in a sinking state by her antagonist, who
was herself in no condition to help. In the confusion,
the <i>Vengeur's</i> peril was for some time not
observed; and when it was, the British ships that
came to her aid had time only to remove part of
her survivors. In their report of the event the
latter said: "Scarcely had the boats pulled clear
of the sides, when the most frightful spectacle
was offered to our gaze. Those of our comrades
who remained on board the <i>Vengeur du Peuple</i>,
with hands raised to heaven, implored, with
lamentable cries, the help for which they could no
longer hope. Soon disappeared the ship and the
unhappy victims it contained. In the midst of
the horror with which this scene inspired us all,
we could not avoid a feeling of admiration mingled
with our grief. As we drew away, we heard some
of our comrades still offering prayers for the
welfare of their country. The last cries of these
unfortunates were, 'Vive la R&eacute;publique!' They
died uttering them." Over a hundred Frenchmen
thus went down.</p>

<p>Seven French ships were captured, including
the sunk <i>Vengeur</i>. Five more were wholly dismasted,
but escaped,&mdash;a good fortune mainly to
be attributed to Howe's utter physical prostration,
due to his advanced years and the continuous
strain of the past five days. He now went to
bed, completely worn out. "We all got round
him," wrote an officer, Lieutenant Codrington,
who was present; "indeed, I saved him from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
tumble, he was so weak that from a roll of the ship
he was nearly falling into the waist. 'Why, you
hold me up as if I were a child,' he said good-humoredly."
Had he been younger, there can be
little doubt that the fruits of victory would have
been gathered with an ardor which his assistant,
Curtis, failed to show. The fullest proof of this
is the anecdote, already quoted in the sketch of
Rodney,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which has been transmitted by Admiral
Sir Byam Martin direct from the sailing-master
of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, afterwards Admiral
Bowen; but his account is abundantly confirmed
by other officers, eye and ear witnesses. Taken
in connection with these, Codrington's story of his
physical weakness bears the note, not of pathos
only, but of encouragement; for the whole testifies
assuredly to the persistence, through great bodily
debility, of a strong quality diligently cultivated
in the days of health and vigor. In truth, it
was impossible for Howe to purpose otherwise.
Having been continuously what he was in his
prime, it could not be that he would not intend,
with all the force of his will, to persevere to the
utmost in the duty before him. The faithfulness
of a lifetime does not so forsake a man in his
end. What he lacked in that critical hour was
not the willing mind, but the instrument by which
to communicate to the fleet the impulse which
his own failing powers were no longer able directly
to impart.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Howe's career practically ended with this
battle and the honors that followed it. Infirmities
then gained rapidly upon him, and it would
have been well had his own wish to retire been
granted by the Government. He remained in
nominal command of the Channel Fleet, though
not going to sea, until the occurrence of the great
mutinies of 1797. The suppression&mdash;or, more
properly, the composing&mdash;of this ominous outbreak
was devolved upon him by the ministry.
He very wisely observed that "preventive measures
rather than corrective are to be preferred
for preserving discipline in fleets and armies;"
but it was in truth his own failure to use such
timely remedies, owing to the lethargy of increasing
years, acting upon a temperament naturally
indulgent and unapprehensive, that was largely
responsible for disorders of whose imminence he
had warning. From the military standpoint, the
process of settlement had much the air of op&eacute;ra
bouffe,&mdash;a consummation probably inevitable
when just grievances and undeniable hardships
get no attention until the sufferers break through
all rules, and seek redress by force. The mutinous
seamen protested to Howe the bitterness of their
sorrow at the sense of wrong doing, but in the
same breath insisted that their demands must be
conceded, and that certain obnoxious officers must
be removed from their ships. The demands were
yielded, Howe gently explaining to the men how
naughty they had been; and that, as to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
unpopular officers, they themselves asked relief
from so unpleasant a situation. In his curiously
involved style, he wrote: "This request has been
complied with, under the pretext of an equal
desire on the part of the officers not to be
employed in ships where exception, without
specification of facts, has been taken to their
conduct. However ineligible the concession, it
was become indispensably necessary." Under
this thin veil, men persuaded themselves that
appearances were saved, as a woman hides a smile
behind her fan. Admiral Codrington, a firm
admirer of Howe, justly said: "It was want of
discipline which led to the discontent and mutiny
in the Channel Fleet. Lord Howe got rid of the
mutiny by granting the men all they asked; but
discipline was not restored until the ships most
remarkable for misconduct had been, one after
the other, placed under the command of Lord St.
Vincent."</p>

<p>With the settlement of this mutiny Lord
Howe's long career of active service closed.
Immediately afterwards he retired formally, as
he sometime before had actually, from the command
of the Channel Fleet, and on the 5th of
August, 1799, he died full of years and honors;
having lived just long enough to welcome the rising
star of Nelson's glory as it burst upon men's
sight at Cape St. Vincent and the Nile.</p>

<h4>1735-1823</h4>


<p>The renown of Nelson is part of the heritage
of the world. His deeds, although
their full scope and real significance have been
but little understood, stand out conspicuous
among a host of lesser achievements, and are
become to mankind the symbol of Great Britain's
maritime power in that tremendous era when it
drove the French Revolution back upon itself,
stifling its excesses, and so insuring the survival
of the beneficent tendencies which for a time
seemed well nigh lost in the madness of the
nation.</p>

<p>The appearance of a prodigy like Nelson, however,
is not an isolated event, independent of
antecedents. It is the result of a happy meeting
of genius and opportunity. The hour has come,
and the man. Other men have labored, and the
hero enters into their labors; not unjustly, for
thereto he also has been appointed by those
special gifts which fit him to reap as theirs fitted
them to sow. In relation to Nelson and his
career, the illustrious officer whose most distin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>guishing
characteristics we have now to trace
stood pre-eminent among many forerunners. It
was he, above all others, who made the preparation
indispensable to the approaching triumphal
progress of the first of British naval heroes, so
that his own work underlies that of his successor,
as foundation supports superstructure. There is
not between them the vital connection of root to
branch, of plant to fruit. In the matter of professional
kinship Nelson has far more in common
with Hood. Between these there is an identity
of kind, an orderly sequence of development, an
organic bond, such as knits together the series
of a progressive evolution. It is not so with
Jervis. Closely conjoined as the two men long
were in a common service, and in mutual admiration
and sympathy, it would be an error to think
of the elder as in any sense the professional progenitor
of the younger; yet he was, as it were, an
adoptive father, who from the first fostered, and
to the last gloried in, the genius which he confessed
unparalleled. "It does not become me to
make comparisons," he wrote after Copenhagen;
"all agree that there is but one Nelson." And
when the great admiral had been ten years in his
grave, he said of an officer's gallant conduct at
the Battle of Algiers, "He seems to have felt
Lord Nelson's eye upon him;" as though no
stronger motive could be felt nor higher praise
given.</p>

<p>John Jervis was born on the 20th of January,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
1735, at Meaford, in Staffordshire. He was intended
for his father's profession, the law; but,
by his own account, a disinclination which was
probably natural became invincible through the
advice of the family coachman. "Don't be a
lawyer, Master Jacky," said the old man; "all
lawyers are rogues." Sometime later, his father
receiving the appointment of auditor to Greenwich
Hospital, the family removed to the neighborhood
of London; and there young Jervis,
being thrown in contact with ships and seamen,
and particularly with a midshipman of his own
age, became confirmed in his wish to go to sea.
Failing to get his parents' consent, he ran away
towards the close of the year 1747. From this
escapade he was brought back; but his father,
seeing the uselessness of forcing the lad's inclinations,
finally acquiesced, though it seems likely,
from his after conduct, that it was long before
he became thoroughly reconciled to the disappointment.</p>

<p>In January, 1748, the future admiral and peer
first went afloat in a ship bound to the West
Indies. The time was inauspicious for one making
the navy his profession. The war of the
Austrian succession had just been brought to an
end by the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, and the
monotonous discomfort of hard cruising, unrelieved
by the excitements of battle or the flush of
prize-taking, was the sole prospect of one whose
narrow means debarred him from such pleas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>ures
as the station afforded and youth naturally
prompted him to seek. His pay was little over
twenty pounds a year, and his father had not
felt able to give more than that sum towards
his original outfit. After being three years on
board, practising a rigid economy scarcely to be
expected in one of his years, the lad of sixteen
drew a bill upon home for twenty pounds more.
It came back dishonored. The latent force of his
character was at once aroused. To discharge
the debt, he disposed of his pay tickets at a heavy
discount; sold his bed, and for three years slept
on the deck; left the mess to which he belonged,
living forward on the allowance of a seaman, and
making, mending, and washing his own clothes,
to save expense. Doubt has been expressed as
to the reality of these early privations, on the
ground that his father's office at Greenwich, and
the subsequent promotions of the young officer,
show the existence of a family influence, which
would have counteracted such extreme restriction
in money matters. The particulars, however,
have been so transmitted as to entitle them to
acceptance, unless contradicted by something
more positive than circumstantial inference from
other conditions, not necessarily contradictory.</p>

<p>This sharp experience was singularly adapted
to develop and exaggerate his natural characteristics,
self-reliance, self-control, stern determination,
and, it must be added, the exacting harshness
which demanded of others all that he had himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
accepted. His experience of suffering and deprivation
served, not to enlarge his indulgence, but
to intensify his severity. Yet it may be remarked
that Jervis was at all periods in thorough touch
with distinctively naval feeling, sympathizing
with and respecting its sensibilities, sharing its
prejudices, as well as comprehending its weaknesses.
Herein he differed from Rodney, who in
the matter of community of sentiment stood
habitually external to his profession; in it, but in
heart not of it; belonging consciously and willingly
to a social class which cherished other
ideals of life and action. His familiarity with the
service quickened him to criticise more keenly
and accurately than a stranger, to recognize failings
with harsher condemnation; but there appears
no disposition to identify himself with it
further than as an instrument of personal advancement
and distinction.</p>

<p>Upon Jervis's naval future, the results of his
early ordeal were wholly good. Unable to pursue
pleasure ashore, he stuck to sea-going ships;
and the energies of a singularly resolute mind
were devoted to mastering all the details of his
profession. After six years in the Caribbean,
he returned to England in the autumn of 1754.
The troubles between France and Great Britain
which issued in the Seven Years War had already
begun, and Jervis, whose merit commanded
immediate recognition from those under whom
he served, found family influence to insure his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
speedy promotion and employment. Being made
lieutenant early in 1755, he was with Boscawen
off the Gulf of St. Lawrence when that admiral,
although peace yet reigned, was ordered to seize
the French fleet bearing reinforcements to Quebec.
At the same time, Braddock's unfortunate
expedition was miscarrying in the forests of
Pittsburg. A year later, in 1756, Jervis went to
the Mediterranean with Admiral Hawke, sent to
relieve Byng after the fiasco at Minorca which
brought that unhappy commander to trial and to
death.</p>

<p>Before and during this Mediterranean cruise
Jervis had been closely associated with Sir
Charles Saunders, one of the most distinguished
admirals of that generation, upon whom he made
so favorable an impression that he was chosen
for first lieutenant of the flag-ship, when Saunders,
in 1758, was named to command the fleet to
act against Quebec. The gallant and romantic
General Wolfe, whose death in the hour of victory
saddened the triumph of the conquerors,
embarked in the same ship; and the long passage
favored the growth of a close personal intimacy
between the two young men, who had been
at school together as boys, although the soldier
was several years older than the sailor. The
relations thus formed and the confidences exchanged
are shown by a touching incident recorded
by Jervis's biographer. On the night
before the battle on the Heights of Abraham,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Wolfe went on board the <i>Porcupine</i>, a small sloop
of war to whose command Jervis had meanwhile
been promoted, and asked to see him in private.
He then said that he was strongly impressed with
the feeling that he should fall on the morrow, and
therefore wished to entrust to his friend the miniature
of the lady, Miss Lowther, to whom he was
engaged, and to have from him the promise that,
if the foreboding proved true, he would in person
deliver to her both the portrait and Wolfe's own
last messages. From the interview the young
general departed to achieve his enterprise, to
which daring action, brilliant success, and heroic
death have given a lustre that time itself has not
been able to dim, whose laurels remain green to
our own day; while Jervis, to whose old age was
reserved the glory that his comrade reaped in
youth, remained behind to discharge his last
request,&mdash;a painful duty which, upon returning
to England, was scrupulously fulfilled.</p>

<p>Although the operations against Quebec depended
wholly upon the control of the water by
the navy, its influence, as often happens, was so
quietly exerted as to draw no attention from the
general eye, dazzled by the conspicuous splendor
of Wolfe's conduct. To Jervis had been assigned
the distinguished honor of leading the fleet with
his little ship, in the advance up river against the
fortifications of the place; and it is interesting to
note that in this duty he was joined with the
afterwards celebrated explorer, James Cook, who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
as master of the fleet, had special charge of the
pilotage in those untried waters. Wolfe, Cook,
and Jervis form a striking trio of names, then
unknown, yet closely associated, afterwards to be
widely though diversely renowned.</p>

<p>When the city fell, Commander Jervis was sent
to England, probably with despatches. There he
was at once given a ship, and ordered to return
with her to North America. Upon her proving
leaky, he put in to Plymouth, where, as his mission
was urgent, he was directed to take charge of a
sloop named the <i>Albany</i>, then lying at anchor
near by, and to proceed in her. To this moment
has been attributed an incident which, as regards
time and place, has been more successfully impeached
than the story of his early privations, in
that no mention of it is found in the ship's log;
and there are other discrepancies which need
reconcilement. Nevertheless it is, as told, so
entirely characteristic, that the present writer
has no doubt it occurred, at some time, substantially
as given by his biographer, who was son to
a secretary long in close relations with him when
admiral. It would be entirely in keeping with all
experience of testimony that the old man's recollections,
or those of his secretary, may have gone
astray on minor circumstances, while preserving
accurately the fundamental and only really important
facts, which are perfectly consistent with,
and illustrative of, the stern decision afterwards
shown in meeting and suppressing mutiny of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
most threatening description. The crew of the
<i>Albany</i>, it is said, from some motives of discontent
refused to sail. Jervis had brought with him a few
seamen from his late command. These he ordered
to cut the cables which held the ship to her
anchors, and to loose the foresail. Daunted
more, perhaps, by the bearing of the man than
by the mere acts, the mutineers submitted, and
in twenty-four days, an extraordinarily short passage
for that time, the <i>Albany</i> was at New York.
Here Jervis was unfortunately delayed, and
thus, being prevented from rejoining Sir Charles
Saunders, lost the promotion which a British
commander-in-chief could then give to an officer
in his own command who had merited his professional
approval. It was not until October,
1761, when he was twenty-six, that Jervis obtained
"post" rank,&mdash;the rank, that is, of full, or post,
captain. By the rule of the British navy, an
officer up to that rank could be advanced by
selection; thenceforth he waited, through the
long succession of seniority, for his admiral's
commission. This Jervis did not receive until
1787, when he was fifty-two.</p>

<p>It was as a general officer, as an admiral commanding
great fleets and bearing responsibilities
unusually grave through a most critical period of
his country's history, that Jervis made his high
and deserved reputation. For this reason, the
intervening years, though pregnant with the finished
character and distinguished capacity which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
fitted him for his onerous work, and though by
no means devoid of incident, must be hastily
sketched. The Treaty of Paris, which in 1763
closed the Seven Years War, was followed by
twelve years of peace. Then came the American
Revolution, bringing in its train hostilities with
France and Spain. During the peace, Jervis for
nearly four years commanded a frigate in the
Mediterranean. It is told that while his ship
was at Genoa two Turkish slaves escaped from a
Genoese galley, and took refuge in a British boat
lying at the mole, wrapping its flag round their
persons. Genoese officers took them forcibly
from the boat and restored them to their chains.
Jervis resented this, as being not only an insult
to the British flag, but also an enforcement of
slavery against men under its protection; and so
peremptory was his tone that an apology was made,
the two captives were given up on the frigate's
quarter-deck, and the offending officers punished.
The captain's action, however, was not sustained
by his own government. It is curious to note
that, notwithstanding his course in this case,
and although he was not merely nominally, but
strenuously, a Whig, or Liberal, in political faith,
connected by party ties with Fox and his coterie of
friends, Jervis was always opposed to the abolition
of the slave trade and to the education of the lower
orders. Liberty was to him an inherited worship,
associated with certain stock beliefs and phrases,
but subordination was the true idol of his soul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1775 Captain Jervis commissioned the
<i>Foudroyant</i>, of eighty-four guns, a ship captured
in 1758 from the French, and thereafter thought
to be the finest vessel in the British fleet. To
this, her natural superiority, Jervis added a degree
of order, discipline, and drill which made her the
pride and admiration of the navy. He was forty
when his pennant first flew from her masthead,
and he held the command for eight years, a period
covering the full prime of his own maturity, as
well as the entire course of the American Revolution.
It was also a period marked for him,
professionally, less by distinguished service than
by that perfection of military organization, that
combination of dignified yet not empty pomp
with thorough and constant readiness, which was
so eminently characteristic of all the phases of
Jervis's career, and which, when the rare moments
came, was promptly transformed into unhesitating,
decisive, and efficient action. The <i>Foudroyant</i>, in
her state and discipline, was the type in miniature
of Jervis's Mediterranean fleet, declared by Nelson
to be the finest body of ships he had ever known;
nay, she was the precursor of that regenerate
British navy in which Nelson found the instruments
of his triumphs. Sixty years later, old
officers recalled the feelings of mingled curiosity
and awe with which, when sent to her on duty
from their own ships, they climbed on board the
<i>Foudroyant</i>, and from the larboard side of her
quarter-deck gazed upon the stern captain, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
qualities were embodied in his vessel and constituted
her chief excellences.</p>

<p>During Jervis's command, the <i>Foudroyant</i> was
continuously attached to the Channel Fleet,
whose duty, as the name implies, was to protect
the English Channel and its approaches; a function
which often carried the ships far into the
Bay of Biscay. Thus he took a prominent part
in Keppel's battle off Ushant in 1778, in the
movements occasioned by the entrance into the
Channel of an overpowering Franco-Spanish fleet
in 1779 and 1781, and in the brilliant relief of
Gibraltar by Admiral Howe towards the end of
1782. His most distinguished service, however,
was taking, single-handed, the French seventy-four
<i>P&eacute;gase</i>, in the spring of the latter year. The
capture was effected after an action of fifty minutes,
preceded by a chase of twelve hours, running
before a half-gale of wind. The <i>Foudroyant</i>
was unquestionably superior in battery to her
enemy, who, moreover, had but recently been
commissioned; but, as has justly been remarked
of some of the victories of our own ships over
those of the British in the War of 1812, although
there was disparity of forces, the precision and
rapidity with which the work was done bore incontrovertible
testimony to the skill and training
of the captain and crew. Single combats, such
as this, were rare between vessels of the size of
the <i>Foudroyant</i> and <i>P&eacute;gase</i>, built to sail and fight
in fleets. That one occurred here was due to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
the fact that the speed of the two opponents left
the British squadron far astern. The exploit
obtained for Jervis a baronetcy and the ribbon of
the Order of the Bath.</p>

<p>Sir John Jervis did not serve afloat during the
ten years of peace following 1783, although,
from his high repute, he was one of those summoned
upon each of the alarms of war that from
time to time arose. Throughout this period he
sat in Parliament, voting steadily with his party,
the Whigs, and supporting Fox in his opposition
to measures which seemed to tend towards hostilities
with France. When war came, however,
he left his seat, ready to aid his country with his
sword in the quarrel from which he had sought
to keep her.</p>

<p>Having in the mean time risen from the rank
of captain to that of rear-and of vice-admiral,
Jervis's first service, in 1794, was in the Caribbean
Sea, as commander of the naval part of a
joint expedition of army and navy to subdue the
French West India islands. The operation, although
most important and full of exciting and
picturesque incident, bears but a small share in his
career, and therefore may not be dwelt upon in
so short a sketch as the present aims to be. Attended
at first by marked and general success, it
ended with some severe reverses, occasioned by
the force given him being less than he demanded,
and than the extent of the work to be done required.
A quaintly characteristic story is told of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
the admiral's treatment of a lieutenant who at
this period sought employment on board his ship.
Knowing that he stood high in the old seaman's
favor, the applicant confidently expected his
appointment, but, upon opening the "letter on
service," was stunned to read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">SIR,&mdash;You, having thought fit to take to yourself a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">wife, are to look for no further attentions from<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your humble servant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">J. JERVIS.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The supposed culprit, guiltless even in thought
of this novel misdemeanor, hastened on board,
and explained that he abhorred such an offence
as much as could the admiral. It then appeared
that the letter had been sent to the wrong person.
Jervis was himself married at this time; but his
well-regulated affections had run steadily in harness
until the mature age of forty-eight, and he
saw no reason why other men should depart
from so sound a precedent. "When an officer
marries," he tersely said, "he is d&mdash;&mdash;d for the
service."</p>

<p>Returning to England in February, 1795, Jervis
was in August nominated to command the Mediterranean
station, and in November sailed to take
up his new duties. At the end of the month, in
San Fiorenzo Bay, an anchorage in the north
of Corsica, he joined the fleet, which continued
under his flag until June, 1799. He had now
reached the highest rank in his profession, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
not the highest grade of that rank as it was then
subdivided; being a full Admiral of the Blue.
The crowning period of his career here began.
Admirable and striking as had been his previous
services, dignified and weighty as were the responsibilities
borne by him in the later part of a
life prolonged far beyond the span of man, the
four years of Jervis's Mediterranean command
stand conspicuous as the time when preparation
flowered into achievement, solid, durable, and
brilliant. It may be interesting to Americans to
recall that his age was nearly the same as that
of Farragut when the latter assumed the charge
in which, after long years of obscure preparation,
he also reaped his harvest of glory. It is likewise
worthy of note that this happy selection
was made wholly independent of the political
bias, which till then had so often and unworthily
controlled naval appointments. Jervis
belonged to the small remnant of Whigs who
still followed Fox and inveighed against the current
war, as unnecessary and impolitic. It was
a pure service choice, as such creditable alike to
the Government and the officer.</p>

<p>Though distinguished success now awaited
him, a period of patient effort, endurance, and
disappointment had first to be passed, reproducing
in miniature the longer years of faithful
service preceding his professional triumphs.
Jervis came to the Mediterranean too late for
the best interests of England. The year 1795, just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
ending, was one in which the energies of France,
after the fierce rush of the Terror, had flagged
almost to collapse. Not only so, but in its
course the republic, discouraged by frequent
failure, had decided to abandon the control of
the sea to its enemy, to keep its great fleets in
port, and to confine its efforts to the harassment
of British commerce. To this change of policy in
France is chiefly to be ascribed the failure of
naval achievement with which Macaulay has reproached
Pitt's earlier ministry. Battles cannot
be fought if the foe keeps behind his walls.
Prior to this decision, two fleet battles had been
fought in the Mediterranean in the spring and
summer of 1795, in which the British had missed
great successes only through the sluggishness of
their admiral. "To say how much we wanted
Lord Hood" (the last commander-in-chief), wrote
Nelson, "is to ask, 'Will you have all the French
fleet or no battle?'" Could he have foreseen all
that Jervis was to be to the Mediterranean, his
distress must have been doubled to know that
the fortunes of the nation thus fell between two
stools.</p>

<p>His predecessor's slackness in pushing military
opportunities, due partly to ill health,
was mainly constitutional, and therefore could
not but show itself by tangible evidences in
the more purely administrative and disciplinary
work. Jervis found himself at once under
the necessity of bringing his fleet&mdash;in equip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>ment,
in discipline, and in drill&mdash;sharply up
to that level of efficiency which is essential to the
full development of power when occasion offers.
This his perfect achievement, of organization and
administration, in its many intricate details, needs
at least to be clearly noted, even though space do
not admit many particulars; because his capacity
as administrator at the head of the Admiralty a
few years later has been seriously impugned,
by a criticism both partial and excessive, if not
wholly unjust. Nelson, a witness of his Mediterranean
service from beginning to end, lauded to
the utmost the excellence there reached, and
attributed most of the short-coming noted in
the later office to the yielding of a man then
advanced in years, to advisers, in trusting
whom fully he might well believe himself warranted
by experience.</p>

<p>Although, when taking command, his fleet
reached the seemingly large proportions of twenty-five
ships-of-the-line and some fifty cruisers,
heavy allowance must be made for the variety
of services extending over the two thousand
miles of the Mediterranean, from east to west.
Seven of-the-line had to be kept before Cadiz,
though still a neutral port, to check a French
division within. One of the same class was on
the Riviera with Nelson; and other demands,
with the necessities of occasional absences for
refit, prevented the admiral from ever assembling
before Toulon, his great strategic care, much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
more than a round dozen to watch equal French
numbers there. The protection of Corsica, then
in British hands; the convoy of commerce, dispersed
throughout the station; the assurance of
communications to the fortress and Straits of
Gibraltar, by which all transit to and from the
Mediterranean passes; diplomatic exigencies
with the various littoral states of the inland sea;
these divergent calls, with the coincident necessity
of maintaining every ship in fit condition for
action, show the extent of the administrative
work and of the attendant correspondence. The
evidence of many eye-witnesses attests the successful
results.</p>

<p>Similar attention, broad yet minute, was
demanded for the more onerous and invidious
task of enforcing relaxed discipline and drill.
Concerning these, the most pregnant testimony,
alike to the stringency and the persistence of his
measures, may be found in the imbittered expressions
of enemies. Five years later, when the
rumor spread that he was to have the Channel
Fleet, the toast was drunk at the table of the
man then in command, "May the discipline of
the Mediterranean never be introduced into the
Channel." "May his next glass of wine choke
the wretch," is a speech attributed to a captain's
wife, wrathful that her husband was kept from
her side by the admiral's regulations. For
Jervis's discipline began at the top, with the
division and ship commanders. One of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
senior admirals under him persisting in a remonstrance,
beyond the point which he considered
consistent with discipline, was sent home. "The
very disorderly state of His Majesty's ship under
your command," he writes to a captain, "obliges
me to require that neither yourself nor any of your
officers are to go on shore on what is called pleasure."
"The commander-in-chief finds himself
under the painful necessity of publicly reprimanding
Captains &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; for neglect of duty, in
not maintaining the stations assigned to their ships
during the last night." In a letter to a lieutenant
he says, "If you do not immediately make a
suitable apology to Commissioner Inglefield for
the abominable neglect and disrespect you have
treated him with, I will represent your behaviour
to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty,
and recommend your name to be struck off the
list of lieutenants." Captains of vessels were not
only subject to strict regulation as to their personal
proceedings, compelled to sleep on board, for
instance, even in home ports; but duties customarily
left to subordinates, with results to discipline
that might not now obtain but which
were in those days deplorable, were also assigned
to them.</p>

<p>"The commander-in-chief has too exalted an
opinion of the respective captains of the squadron
to doubt their being upon deck when the signal
is made to tack or wear <i>in the night</i>, and he requires
all lieutenants then to be at their stations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
except those who had the watch immediately preceding."
Nor did he leave this delicately worded,
but pointed, admonition, issued in the Mediterranean,
to take care of itself. In after years, when
he was nigh seventy, his secretary tells that on a
cold and rainy November night off Brest, the signal
to tack being made, he hurried to the cabin to
persuade the old man not to go on deck, as was his
custom. He was not, however, in his cot, nor
could he for a long time be found; but at last a
look into the stern gallery discovered him, in
flannel dressing-gown and cocked hat, watching
the movements of the fleet. To remonstrance he
replied, "Hush, I want to see how the evolution
is performed on such a night, and to know
whether Jemmy Vashon (commanding the ship
next astern) is on deck;" but soon hearing the
captain's well-known shrill voice, crying, "Are you
all ready forward?" he consented then to retire.</p>

<p>Post-captains and commanders were required
to attend at points on shore where the boats and
crews of ships congregated on service; at landing
places and watering places,&mdash;scenes fruitful in
demoralization,&mdash;to maintain order and suppress
disturbance. "The Masters and Commanders
are to take it in turn, according to rank, to attend
the duty on shore at the ragged staff [at Gibraltar],
from gun-fire in the morning to sunset, to keep
order and prevent disputes, and to see that boats
take their regular turns. They are never to
be absent from the spot except at regular meal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
times." "When the squadron is at anchor in
Torbay [in the English Channel], a captain of a
ship-of-the-line is to command at the watering
place at Brixham, taking to his assistance his
commanding officer of marines with a party of
his men. He also may take with him a lieutenant
of the ship and as many midshipmen as he thinks
fit; <i>but he himself</i> is not to quit his command
until regularly relieved." A greater stringency
is observable at this later date, in the Channel
Fleet, than in the Mediterranean; for at the
earlier period the spirit of mutiny had not openly
broken out, and he had besides on the distant
station better captains than those who had clung
to the home fleet under its lax discipline. "Old
women in the guise of young men," he affirmed
many of them to be.</p>

<p>There was in fact an imminent necessity that
naval rank should be made to feel its responsibilities,
and to exert its predominance; to be restored
to prestige, not by holding aloof in its privileges,
but by asserting itself in act. The preponderance
of political and family influence in determining
promotion of officers, unbalanced by valid tests of
fitness such as later days imposed, had not only
lowered the competency of the official body as a
whole, but impaired the respect which personal
merit alone can in the long run maintain. On the
other hand, the scarcity of seamen in proportion
to the heavy demands of the war, and the irregular
methods of impressment and recruiting then pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>vailing,
swept into the service a vast number of
men not merely unfit, but of extremely bad character,&mdash;"miscreants,"
to use Collingwood's word,&mdash;to
be ruled only by fear of the law and of their
officers, supported by the better element among
the crews. But these better men also were becoming
alienated by the harsh restrictions of the
times, and by the procrastination of superiors&mdash;Howe,
the Sailor's Friend, among others&mdash;to
heed their just complaints. The stern Jervis,
whom none suspected of fatherly tenderness, if
less indulgent to culprits, was far more attentive
to meet the reasonable demands of those under
him. While quelling insubordination mercilessly,
he ever sought to anticipate grievance; exhibiting
thus the two sides of the same spirit of careful,
even-handed justice.</p>

<p>Jervis's work during the first eighteen months
of his command was therefore not only necessary,
but most timely. By improving that period of
comparative internal quiet, he educated his officers
and men to pass steadfastly, though not unmoved,
through the awful crisis of the mutinies in 1797-98.
Professional self-respect, a most powerful
moral force, was more than restored; it was intensified
by the added dignity and power manifest
in the surroundings of daily life, as well as in the
military results obtained. Seamen, like others,
deal more conservatively with that of which they
are proud because it reflects honor upon themselves;
and they obey more certainly men who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
share their labors and lead them capably in
danger, as did Jervis's Mediterranean captains.
With himself, severity was far from being the
only instrument. Thoroughly capable professionally,
and thereby commandful of respect, he
appealed also to men's regard by intelligent and
constant thought for the wants and comfort of
those under him; by evidence of strong service
feeling on his own part; by clear and clearly
expressed recognition of merit, wherever found;
by avoidance of misunderstandings through explanation
volunteered when possible,&mdash;not apologetically,
but as it were casually, yet appealing
to men's reason. Watchfulness and sympathetic
foresight were with him as constant as sternness,
though less in evidence.</p>

<p>Of this prevalence of kindly naval feeling amid
the harshness which seemed superficially the
chief characteristic of his rule, many instances
could be cited. Passing by the frequent incidental
praise of distinguished captains, Nelson,
Troubridge, and others, he thus advocates the
claims of one of the humble, hopeless class of
sailing-masters, out of the line of promotion.
After an act of brilliant merit in the West Indies,
"Mr. White was ambitious to become a lieutenant;
but not having served six years in the navy,
and being a master, I could not then comply with
his wishes. He is now Master of the <i>Defence</i>, and
his captain speaks in the highest terms of him;
and it is a tribute <i>due to the memory</i> of Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Faulknor,&mdash;whose certificate of that matchless
service is enclosed,&mdash;and <i>to the gallantry of his
officers and crew</i>, to state the claims of Mr. White
to your Lordship, who is the protector of us all."
The present and the past, the merits of the living,
the memory of the glorious dead, the claims of
the navy to see well-doers rewarded, are all pressed
into service to support a just request, and with
a manifest heartiness which in virtue of its reality
approaches eloquence. "I have given an order
to Mr. Ellis to command as a lieutenant, he being
the son of a very old officer whom I knew many
years; and coming very strongly recommended
from his last ship, I place him under your Lordship's
protection as <i>a child of the service</i>."
When a man thus bears others' deserts and
the profession on his heart, he can retain the
affections of his subordinates even though he
show all the unbending severity of Jervis, and
despite the numerous hangings, which, for that
matter, rarely fell except on the hopelessly bad.
A most significant feature of his rule as a disciplinarian
was his peculiar care of health, by
instructed sanitary measures, by provision of
suitable diet, and by well-ordered hospital service.
This was not merely a prudential consideration
for the efficiency of the fleet; he regarded also
the welfare of the sufferers. He made it a rule
to inspect the hospitals himself, and he directed
a daily visit by a captain and by the surgeons of
the ships from which patients were sent, thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
keeping the sick in touch with those they knew,
and who had in them a personal interest. An
odd provision, amusingly illustrative of the obverse
side of the admiral's character, was that
the visiting captain should be accompanied by
a boatswain's mate, the functionary charged with
administering floggings, and, "if they find the
patients do not conduct themselves properly and
orderly, they are to punish them agreeably to the
rules of the Navy." It was, however, on his care
of health, in its various exposures, that the admiral
specially valued himself; it was, he said,
his proudest boast among the services to which
he laid claim.</p>

<p>But while he labored thus for the welfare of
the seamen, it was naturally upon the professional
tone of his officers that his chief reliance must be
placed; and the leaders among them he grappled
to his soul with hooks of steel, as they recognized
the wisdom and force of his measures, and the
appreciation given to them and others. Whatever
beneficent influence might issue from him
as a fountain-head must through them be distributed,
and by them reinforced and sustained.
"The discipline of the fleet," he said, "is in the
ward-room;" and greatly did he lament the loose
insubordinate talk, the spirit of irresponsible criticism
that found voice at mess-tables, within the
hearing of servants, by whom it was disseminated
throughout the body of the ship. Not only he,
but many, attributed to this hot-bed the fomenting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
of discontent into organized mutiny. This could
not be stopped by direct measures, but only by
imposing a feeling of fear, and nurturing that of
officer-like propriety, by stringent prescription of
forms of respect and rigid exaction of their observance.
To stand uncovered before a superior,
instead of lightly touching the hat, to pay outward
reverence to the national flag, to salute the
quarter-deck as the seat of authority, were no
vain show under him. "Discipline," he was fond
of quoting, "is summed up in the one word,
'Obedience;'" and these customs were charged
with the observance which is obedience in spirit.
They conduced to discipline as conventional
good manners, by rendering the due of each to
each, knit together the social fabric and maintain
the regularity and efficiency of common life; removing
friction, suppressing jars, and ministering
constantly to the smooth and even working
of the social machinery.</p>

<p>By measures such as these, extending to all
ranks and every detail, exemplifying, in spirit
and in form, the extremes of cordial reward, iron
restraint, and weighty punishment, Jervis patiently
fashioned the fleet which was to be both a pattern
for coming days, and the highly tempered
instrument to achieve his own victory of Cape
St. Vincent and the earlier triumphs of Nelson;
as well as to sustain and to crush the onset of
mutiny which soon afterwards shook the Navy to
its centre. For purely military action of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
aggressive character no opportunity was afforded
him. His coming to the Mediterranean coincided
with that of Napoleon Bonaparte to the Army
of Italy. During 1795, wrote Nelson, if the
British fleet had done its duty, the French army
could not have moved along the Riviera of Genoa.
It failed, and the Austrian general, its ally, also
failed to act with vigor. So the year had ended,
for the Austrians, with a disastrous defeat and a
retreat behind the Apennines. To the Riviera
they never returned to receive the co-operation
which Jervis stood eager to give. At their first
move to cross the mountains, Bonaparte struck,
and followed up his blows with such lightning-like
rapidity that in thirty days they were
driven back over a hundred miles, behind
the Adige; their chief fortress, Mantua, was
blockaded; all northwest Italy with its seaboard,
including Leghorn, was in the power of France;
and Naples also had submitted. Jervis, powerless
to strike a blow when no enemy was within
reach, found his fleet without a friendly port
nearer than Gibraltar, while Corsica, where alone
he could expect anchorage and water, was
seething with revolt against the British crown,
to which, by its own vote, it had been annexed
but two years before.</p>

<p>Amid these adverse circumstances, the only
large operation possible to him was the close
watching of the port of Toulon, conducted on
the same general plan that was afterwards more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
illustriously exhibited before Brest, between 1800
and 1805, under conditions of surpassing difficulty.
All contemplated movements of the
French fleet were thus dammed at the source,
for it must first fight the British, after which
there was little hope of being in a state to fulfil
any further mission. For six months, from April
to October, Jervis held his fleet close up to the
port, the advanced body two miles from the
entrance. The effort was admirable as a pattern,
and for disciplinary purposes. The ships, forced
to self-dependence, became organically self-reliant.
Their routine life of seamanship and military
exercise perfected habit and efficiency, and difficulties
to others insuperable were as the light
burdens which a giant carries unwittingly.</p>

<p>Further than this, achievement could not then
go. During the summer Bonaparte held Mantua
by the throat, and overthrew one after another
the Austrian forces approaching to its
relief. Two French armies, under Jourdan and
Moreau, penetrated to the heart of Germany;
while Spain, lately the confederate of Great
Britain, made an offensive and defensive alliance
with France, and sent a fleet of over twenty
ships-of-the-line into the Mediterranean. Staggered
by these reverses, the British ministry
ordered Corsica evacuated and the Mediterranean
abandoned. Jervis was cruelly embarrassed. A
trusted subordinate of high reputation had been
before Cadiz with seven ships-of-the-line, watch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>ing
a French division in that port. Summoned,
in view of the threatening attitude of Spain, to
reinforce the main fleet in San Fiorenzo Bay, he
lost his head altogether, hurried past Gibraltar
without getting supplies, and brought his ships
destitute to the admiral, already pressed to maintain
the vessels then with him. Although there
were thirty-five hostile ships in Toulon and the
British had only twenty-two, counting this division,
there was nothing to do but to send it back to
Gibraltar, under urgent orders to return with all
speed. With true military insight and a correct
appreciation of the forces opposed to him, Jervis
saw the need of fighting the combined enemies
then and there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the division commander, Admiral
Mann, on reaching Gibraltar, became infected
with the spirit of discouragement then prevailing
in the garrison, called a council of naval captains,
and upon their advice, which could in no wise
lessen his own responsibility, decided to return
to England. This culpably unwarrantable act
aptly illustrates the distinction, rarely appreciated,
between an error of judgment and an error of
conduct. Upon arrival, he was at once deprived
of his command, a step of unquestionable justice,
but which could not help Jervis. "We were all
eyes, looking westward from the mountain tops,"
wrote Collingwood, then a captain in the fleet,
"but we looked in vain. The Spanish fleet,
nearly double our number, was cruising almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
in view, and our reconnoitring frigates sometimes
got among them, while we expected them hourly
to be joined by the French fleet." "I cannot
describe to your lordship," wrote Jervis himself,
"the disappointment my ambition and zeal to
serve my country have suffered by this diminution
of my force; for had Admiral Mann sailed
from Gibraltar on the 10th of October, the day
he received my orders, and fulfilled them, I have
every reason to believe the Spanish fleet would
have been cut to pieces. The extreme disorder
and confusion they were observed to be in, by
the judicious officers who fell in with them, leave
no doubt upon my mind that a fleet so trained
and generally well commanded as this is would
have made its way through them in every direction."</p>

<p>Nelson shared this opinion, the accuracy of
which was soon to be tested and proved. "They
at home," wrote he to his wife, "do not know
what this fleet is capable of performing; anything
and everything. The fleets of England
are equal to meet the world in arms; and of all
the fleets I ever saw, I never beheld one, in point
of officers and men, equal to Sir John Jervis's,
who is a commander-in-chief able to lead them
to glory." To a friend he wrote: "Mann is
ordered to come up; we shall then be twenty-two
sail-of-the-line such as England hardly ever produced,
commanded by an admiral who will not
fail to look the enemy in the face, be their force<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
what it may. I suppose it will not be more than
thirty-four of-the-line." "The admiral is firm as
a rock," wrote at the same moment the British
viceroy of Corsica. Through all doubts and uncertainties
he held on steadily, refusing to leave
the rendezvous till dire necessity forced him, lest
Mann, arriving, should be exposed alone and
lost. At last, with starvation staring him in the
face if delaying longer, he sailed for Gibraltar,
three men living on the rations of one during
the passage down.</p>

<p>Mann's defection had reduced the fleet from
twenty-two vessels to fifteen. A series of single
accidents still further diminished it. In a violent
gale at Gibraltar three ships-of-the-line drove
from their anchors. One, the <i>Courageux</i>, stretching
over toward the Barbary coast, ran ashore
there and was totally wrecked, nearly all her crew
perishing. Her captain, a singularly capable seaman
named Hallowell, was out of her upon a
courtmartial, and it was thought she would not
have been lost had he been on board. Another,
the <i>Gibraltar</i>, struck so heavily on a reef that
she had to be sent to England. Upon being
docked, a large piece of rock was found to have
penetrated the bottom and stuck fast in the hole.
Had it worked out, the ship would have foundered.
The third vessel, the <i>Zealous</i>, was less
badly hurt, but she had to be left behind in
Gibraltar when Jervis, by orders from home, took
his fleet to Lisbon. There, in entering the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
Tagus, a fourth ship was lost on a shoal, so that
but eleven remained out of twenty-two. Despite
these trials of his constancy, the old man's temper
still continued "steady as a rock." "Whether
you send me a reinforcement or not," he wrote
to the Admiralty, "I shall sleep perfectly sound,&mdash;not
in the Tagus, but at sea; for as soon as
the <i>St. George</i> has shifted her topmast, the
<i>Captain</i> her bowsprit, and the <i>Blenheim</i> repaired
her mainmast, I will go out." "Inactivity in the
Tagus," he wrote again, "will make cowards of
us all." This last expression summed up much
of his naval philosophy. Keep men at sea, he
used to say, and they cannot help being seamen,
though attention will be needed to assure exercise
at the guns. And it may be believed he
would thus contemn the arguments which supported
Howe's idea of preserving the ships by
retaining them in port. Keep them at sea, he
would doubtless have replied, and they will learn
to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>In quitting the river another vessel took the
ground, and had to be left behind. This, however,
was the last of the admiral's trials for that
time. A few days later, on the 6th of February,
1797, there joined him a body of five ships-of-the line,
detached from England as soon as the
government had been freed from the fear of the
invasion of Ireland, which the French had attempted
on a large scale in December. On the
13th, Nelson, a host in himself, returned from an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
adventurous mission up the Mediterranean. The
next day, February 14th, Jervis with his fifteen
ships met a Spanish fleet of twenty-seven some
thirty miles from Cape St. Vincent, which has
given its name to the battle.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were running for Cadiz, to the
east-southeast,&mdash;say, across the page from left to
right, inclining a little downward,&mdash;while Jervis's
fleet was approaching nearly at right angles
from the north, or top of the page. It was in
two close, compact columns, of seven and eight
ships respectively. The Spaniards, on the contrary,
were in disorder and dispersed. Six of their
ships were far ahead of the others, an interval of
nearly eight miles separating the two groups.
The weather, which was foggy, cleared gradually.
Jervis was walking back and forth on the poop
with Hallowell, lately captain of the wrecked
<i>Courageux</i>, and he was heard to say, "A victory
is very essential to England at this moment."
As ship after ship of the enemy loomed up
through the haze, successive reports were made
to him. "There are eight sail-of-the-line, Sir
John." "There are twenty sail-of-the-line,
Sir John." "There are twenty-five of-the-line,
Sir John." Finally, when the full tale of twenty-seven
was made out, the captain of the fleet remarked
on the greatness of the odds. "Enough
of that, sir," retorted the admiral, intent on that
victory which was so essential to England; "if
there are fifty sail, I will go through them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
This reply so delighted Hallowell, an eccentric
man, who a year later gave Nelson the coffin
made from the mainmast of the <i>Orient</i>, that he
patted his august superior on the back. "That's
right, Sir John," said he, "and, by G&mdash;&mdash;, we'll
give them a d&mdash;&mdash;d good licking!"</p>

<p>When the weather finally cleared, toward 10 A.M.,
the British were near to the enemy and heading
direct for the gap, which the Spaniards,
too late, were trying to close. Almost at the
moment of meeting, Jervis formed his two columns
into one&mdash;the order of battle&mdash;"with the
utmost celerity;" thus doubling the length of
the line interposed between the two divisions of
the enemy. Soon opened the guns of the leading
ship, the <i>Culloden</i>, Captain Troubridge; the
reports following one another in regular succession,
as though firing a salute by watch. The
<i>Culloden's</i> course led so direct upon a Spanish
three-decker, that the first lieutenant reported a
collision imminent. "Can't help it, Griffiths,"
replied Troubridge; "hardest fend off." But
the Spaniard, in confusion, put his helm up and
went clear. By this time the Spanish division
on the right, or west, of the British had changed
its course and was steering north, parallel but opposite
to its foes. As the <i>Culloden</i> went through,
the admiral signalled her to put about and follow
it. Troubridge, fully expecting this order, obeyed
at once; and Jervis's signal was scarce unfurled
when, by the flapping of the <i>Culloden's</i> sails, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
saw it was receiving execution. "Look at Troubridge!"
he shouted. "Doesn't he handle his
ship as though the eyes of all England were on
him? I would to God they were, that she might
know him as I know him!" But here a graver
matter drew the admiral's care. The Spanish
division from the left, steering across his path of
advance, approached, purposing in appearance to
break through the line. The <i>Victory</i> stopped,
or, as seamen say, hove-to; and as the Spanish
admiral came near within a hundred yards, her
broadside rang out, sweeping through the crowded
decks and lofty spars a storm of shot, to which,
in the relative positions, the foe could not reply.
Staggered and crippled he went about, and the
<i>Victory</i> stood on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the ships which Troubridge and his
followers were pursuing drew toward the tail of
the British column, and as they did so made a
movement to pass round it, and so join their
friends who had just been so severely handled in
making the attempt to pass through. But Nelson
was in this part of the order, there being but two
ships behind him. Now, as far as signals went,
he should continue on, and, like the others, follow
in due succession behind the <i>Culloden</i>. He saw
that if this were done the Spaniards would effect
their junction, so he instantly turned his ship
toward the rear, out of her place, and threw her
alone across the enemy's advance. It is said that
the Captain of the Fleet drew Jervis's attention to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
this breach of discipline. "Ay," replied the old
seaman, "and if ever you offend in the same way,
I promise you my forgiveness beforehand." For
a while Nelson took the brunt of the hostile fire
from half a dozen ships, but not for long. Soon
Troubridge, his dearest friend, came up with a
couple of others; and Collingwood, the close associate
of early days, who had the rear ship, was
signalled to imitate Nelson's act. In doing this,
he silenced the fire of two enemies; but, wrote
Nelson, "disdaining the parade of taking possession
of beaten ships, Captain Collingwood most
gallantly pushed on to save his old friend and
messmate, who appeared to be in a critical state,
being then fired upon by three first-rates, and the
<i>San Nicolas</i>, eighty." To get between Nelson's
ship and the <i>San Nicolas</i>, Collingwood had to
steer close, passing within ten feet of the latter;
so that, to use his own expression, "though we
did not touch sides, you could not put a bodkin
between us." His fire drove the <i>San Nicolas</i>
upon one of the first-rates, the <i>San Josef</i>; and
when, continuing on to seek other unbeaten foes,
he left the field again clear for Nelson, the latter,
by a movement of the helm, grappled the <i>San
Nicolas</i>. Incredible as it may appear, the crew
of this one British seventy-four carried, sword in
hand, both the enemy's ships, though of far superior
force. "Extravagant as the story may
seem," wrote Nelson, "on the quarter-deck of a
Spanish first-rate I received the swords of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
vanquished Spaniards, which, as I received, I gave
to William Fearney, one of my bargemen, who
placed them with the greatest <i>sang-froid</i> under
his arm."</p>

<p>Four Spanish ships, two of them of the largest
size, were the trophies of this victory; but its
moral effect in demonstrating the relative values
of the two navies, and the confidence England
could put in men like Jervis, Nelson, and the
leading captains, was far greater. The spirit of
the nation, depressed by a long series of reverses,
revived like a giant refreshed with wine.
Jervis had spoken truth when he said a victory
was essential to England at that time. The
gratitude of the state was shown in the profusion
of rewards showered upon the victors. Promotions
and honors were liberally distributed. The
Government had already purposed to recognize
Jervis's previous services by raising him to the
lower ranks of the peerage; but this timely triumph
procured him at one step a higher elevation.
He was created Earl of St. Vincent, with
a pension of three thousand pounds per annum.</p>

<p>The tactical decisions made by Jervis on this
momentous occasion were correct as far as they
went; but, except the initial determination to
attack the larger body of the enemy, because to
windward, there is no evidence of tactical originality
in him, no innovation comparable to
Howe's manoeuvres on May 28 and 29,&mdash;and
there was undoubted oversight in not providing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
by signal against that move of the weather Spanish
division which it became Nelson's opportunity
and glory to counteract. It is also possible that
the signal to tack in succession, a wholly routine
proceeding, might have been made earlier to
advantage; but the writer does not think that
the body of the fleet should then have tacked
together, as some criticism would have it. Until
the British van approached on the new tack, the
broadsides of the centre were better ranged on
the original line to counteract the efforts, actually
made, by the lee Spanish division to break
through. As regards the decision not to follow
the victory further, which has been censured in
the instances of Rodney and Howe, the conditions
here differed in much. The disparity of
numbers was very great; if many of the enemy
had suffered greatly, many also had not suffered
at all; they were now reunited; above all Jervis's
strategic and political insight&mdash;far superior to
his tactical equipment&mdash;had rightly read the
situation when he said that what England needed
was a victory,&mdash;moral effect. The victory was
there, undeniable and brilliant, it was better not
risked.</p>

<p>The rest of the Spaniards, many of them badly
crippled, took refuge in Cadiz, and there Jervis,
after repairing damages, held them blockaded for
two years, from April, 1797, to May, 1799. For
the greater part of this time the operation was
conducted by anchoring the British fleet, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
resource which the character of the ground
permitted, and which, though not everywhere
possible, St. Vincent declared the only way of
assuring the desired end of holding a position
in all weathers. During this period was rendered
the other most signal service done by
him to the state, in suppressing the mutinous action
of the seamen, which there, as everywhere
else in the British navy at that time, sought to
overthrow the authority of the officers.</p>

<p>The cause of the mutinies of 1797 is not here
in question. Suffice it to say that, in their origin,
they alleged certain tangible material grievances
which were clearly stated, and, being undeniable,
were redressed. The men returned to their duty;
but, like a horse that has once taken the bit
between his teeth, the restive feeling remained,
fermenting in a lot of vicious material which the
exigencies of the day had forced the navy to
accept. Coinciding in time with the risings in
Ireland, 1796-1798, there arose between the two
movements a certain sympathy, which was fostered
by the many Irish in the fleets, where agents
were in communication with the leaders of the
United Irishmen on shore.</p>

<p>In the Channel and the North Sea, the seamen
took the ships, with few exceptions, out of
the hands of their officers. In the former, they
dictated their terms; in the latter, after a month
of awful national suspense, they failed: the difference
being that in the one case the demands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
being reasonable, carried conviction, while in the
other, becoming extravagant, the Government's
resistance was supported by public opinion. It
remained to be seen how the crisis would be met
in a fleet so far from home that the issue must
depend upon the firmness and judgment of a
man of adamant. It was no more than prudent
to expect that the attempt would be made there
also; and the watchfulness of the superior
officers of the fleet soon obtained certain information
of its approach, though as yet without
proof adequate to the arrest of individuals. The
policy of the admiral, broadly stated, was that of
isolating ship from ship&mdash;<i>divide et impera</i>&mdash;to
prevent concerted action; a measure effected to
all practical purpose by his unremitting vigilance,
and by the general devotion to his policy among
his leading officers. On the other hand, evidence
was not wanting that in the ships long under his
orders his own character was now fairly understood,
and obtained for him a backing among the
seamen themselves, without which his severity
alone might have failed.</p>

<p>The first overt sign of trouble was the appearance
of letters addressed to the leading petty
officers of the different ships of the Mediterranean
fleet. These were detected by a captain,
who held on to them, and sent to St. Vincent to
ask if they should be delivered. Careful to betray
no sign of anxiety, the admiral's reply was a
general signal for a lieutenant from each ship to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
come to him; and by them word was sent that
all letters should be delivered as addressed, unopened.
"Should any disturbance arise," he
added, "the commander-in-chief will know how
to repress it."</p>

<p>Disturbance soon did arise, and it is significant
to note that it appeared in a ship which, by taking
the ground when leaving Lisbon, had not
shared in the Battle of St. Vincent. In July,
1797, two seamen of the <i>St. George</i> had been
condemned to death for an infamous crime.
Their shipmates presented a petition, framed in
somewhat peremptory terms, for their liberation,
on the ground that execution for such an offence
would bring disgrace upon all. The admiral
refusing to pardon, the occasion was seized to
bring mutiny to a head. A plot to take possession
of the ship was formed, but was betrayed to
the captain. The outburst began with a tumultuous
assembling of the crew, evidently, however,
mistrustful of their cause. After vainly trying to
restore order, the captain and first lieutenant
rushed among them, each collaring a ringleader.
The rest fell back, weakened, as men of Anglo-Saxon
traditions are apt to be, by the sense of
law-breaking. The culprits were secured, and at
once taken to the flag-ship. A courtmartial was
ordered for the next day, Saturday; and as the
prisoners were being taken to the court, St. Vincent,
with a hard bluntness of speech which characterized
him,&mdash;a survival of the frank brutality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
of the past century,&mdash;said, "My friends, I hope
you are innocent, but if you are guilty make
your peace with God; for, if you are condemned,
and there is daylight to hang you, you will die
this day."</p>

<p>They were condemned; but the trial ended
late, and the president of the court told them
they should have Sunday to prepare. "Sir," said
the earl, "when you passed sentence, your duty
was done; you had no right to say that execution
should be delayed;" and he fixed it for eight the
next morning. One of the junior admirals saw
fit to address him a remonstrance upon what he
termed a desecration of the Sabbath. Nelson, on
the contrary, approved. "Had it been Christmas
instead of Sunday," wrote he, "I would have
hanged them. Who can tell what mischief would
have been brewed over a Sunday's grog?" Contrary
to previous custom, their own shipmates,
the partners and followers in their crime, were
compelled to hang them, manning the rope by
which the condemned were swayed to the yardarm.
The admiral, careful to produce impression,
ordered that all the ships should hold divine
service immediately upon the execution. Accordingly,
when the bell struck eight, the fatal gun
was fired, the bodies swung with a jerk aloft, the
church flags were hoisted throughout the fleet,
and all went to prayers. Ere yet the ceremony
was over, the Spanish gunboats came out from
Cadiz and opened fire; but St. Vincent would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
not mar the solemnity of the occasion by shortening
the service. Gravely it was carried to its
end; but when the flags came down, all boats
were ordered manned. The seamen, with nerves
tense from the morning's excitement, gladly
hurried into action, and the enemy were forced
back into port.</p>

<p>One such incident was far from ending the
ordeal through which the admiral had to pass,
and which was prolonged throughout the period
of the Cadiz blockade. In May, 1798, when
Nelson was sent into the Mediterranean to win
the Battle of the Nile, the detachment committed
to him was replaced by a dozen ships-of-the-line
from the Channel, seething with the mutinous
temper which at home had been humored rather
than scotched. Immediately on their joining,
request was made for a Court Martial on some
men of the <i>Marlborough</i>, on board which two
violent mutinies had occurred,&mdash;one on the
passage out. St. Vincent, having known beforehand
that this ship had been pre-eminent for insubordination,
had ordered her anchored in the
centre of the fleet, between the two lines in which
it was ranged; and the Court met without delay.
The remainder of the incident is quoted substantially
from one of St. Vincent's biographers, for it
illustrates most forcibly the sternness of his action,
as well when dealing with weakness in officers
as with mutiny in crews. The written order to
the commander of the division of launches appears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
among the earl's papers, as does also a similar
one in the case of a mutiny on board the <i>Defence</i>
some months earlier. The ulterior object of
parading these boats was kept profoundly secret.
They appeared to be only part of the pageantry,
of the solemn ceremonial, with which the wisdom
of the great commander-in-chief providently
sought to invest all exhibitions of authority, in
order to deepen impression.</p>

<p>The object of the last mutiny on board the
<i>Marlborough</i> had been to protect the life of a
seaman forfeited by a capital crime. No sooner
was one sentenced to die than the commander-in-chief
ordered him to be executed on the following
morning, "and by the crew of the <i>Marlborough</i>
alone, no part of the boats' crews from
the other ships, as had been used on similar
occasions, to assist in the punishment,&mdash;his
lordship's invariable order on the execution of
mutineers. On the receipt of the necessary commands
for this execution, Captain Ellison of the
<i>Marlborough</i> waited upon the commander-in-chief,
and reminding his lordship that a determination
that their shipmates should not suffer capital
punishment had been the very cause of the ship's
company's mutiny, expressed his conviction that
the <i>Marlborough's</i> crew would never permit the
man to be hanged on board that ship.</p>

<p>"Receiving the captain on the <i>Ville de Paris's</i>
quarter-deck, before the officers and ship's company
hearkening in breathless silence to what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
passed, and standing with his hat in his hand over
his head, as was his lordship's invariable custom
during the whole time that any person, whatever
were his rank, even a common seaman, addressed
him on service, Lord St. Vincent listened very
attentively till the captain ceased to speak; and
then after a pause replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Do you mean to tell me, Captain Ellison, that
you cannot <i>command</i> his Majesty's ship, the
<i>Marlborough</i>? for if that is the case, sir, I will
immediately send on board an officer who can.'</p>

<p>"The captain then requested that, at all events,
the boats' crews from the rest of the fleet might,
as always had been customary in the service, on
executions, attend at this also, to haul the man
up; for he really did not expect the <i>Marlborough's</i>
would do it.</p>

<p>"Lord St. Vincent sternly answered: 'Captain
Ellison, you are an old officer, sir, have served
long, suffered severely in the service, and have
lost an arm in action, and I should be very sorry
that any advantage should be now taken of your
advanced years. That man shall be hanged, at
eight o'clock to-morrow morning, <i>and by his own
ship's company</i>: for not a hand from any other
ship in the fleet shall touch the rope. You will
now return on board, sir; and, lest you should
not prove able to command your ship, an officer
will be at hand who can.'</p>

<p>"Without another word Captain Ellison instantly
retired. After he had reached his ship,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
he received orders to cause her guns to be housed
and secured, and that at daybreak in the morning
her ports should be lowered. A general order
was then issued to the fleet for all launches to
rendezvous under the <i>Prince</i> at seven o'clock on
the following morning, armed with carronades
and twelve rounds of ammunition for service;
each launch to be commanded by a lieutenant,
having an expert and trusty gunner's-mate and
four quarter gunners, exclusive of the launch's
crew. The whole were to be under the command
of Captain Campbell, of the <i>Blenheim</i>, to
whom, on presenting to him the written orders
under which he was to act, Lord St. Vincent
further said, 'he was to attend the execution, and
if any symptoms of mutiny appeared in the <i>Marlborough</i>,
any attempt to open her ports, or any
resistance to the hanging of the prisoner, he was
to proceed close touching the ship, and to fire
into her, and to continue to fire until all mutiny
or resistance should cease; and that, should it
become absolutely necessary, he should even sink
the ship in face of the fleet.'</p>

<p>"Accordingly, at seven the next morning, all
the launches, thus armed, proceeded, from the
<i>Prince</i> to the <i>Blenheim</i>, and thence, Captain
Campbell having assumed the command, to the
<i>Marlborough</i>.</p>

<p>"Having lain on his oars a short time alongside,
the captain then formed his force in a line
athwart her bows, at rather less than pistol shot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
distance off, and then he ordered the tompions
to be taken out of the carronades, and to load.</p>

<p>"At half-past seven, the hands throughout the
fleet having been turned up to witness punishment,
the eyes of all bent upon a powerfully
armed boat as it quitted the flag-ship; every one
knowing that there went the provost-marshal
conducting his prisoner to the <i>Marlborough</i> for
execution. The crisis was come; now was to be
seen whether the <i>Marlborough's</i> crew would hang
one of their own men.</p>

<p>"The ship being in the centre between the
two lines of the fleet, the boat was soon alongside,
and the man was speedily placed on the cathead
and haltered. A few awful minutes of universal
silence followed, which was at last broken
by the watch bells of the fleet striking eight
o'clock. Instantly the flag-ship's gun fired, and
at the sound the man was lifted well off;
but then, and visibly to all, he dropped back
again; and the sensation throughout the fleet
was intense. For, at this dreadful moment, when
the eyes of every man in every ship was straining
upon this execution, as the decisive struggle
between authority and mutiny, as if it were
destined that the whole fleet should see the
hesitating unwillingness of the <i>Marlborough's</i>
crew to hang their rebel, and the efficacy of
the means taken to enforce obedience, by an
accident on board the ship the men at the yard-rope
unintentionally let it slip, and the turn of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
the balance seemed calamitously lost; but then
they hauled him up to the yard arm with a run.
The law was satisfied, and, said Lord St. Vincent
at the moment, perhaps one of the greatest
of his life, 'Discipline is preserved, sir!'"</p>

<p>Again a year later, in May, 1799, when twenty-five
French ships-of-the-line broke through the
wretchedly inefficient guard at that time kept
before Brest, and entered the Mediterranean, a
reinforcement of over a dozen was sent from the
Channel to Lord St. Vincent, who was found then
in Port Mahon, Minorca. Sir Edward Pellew,
captain of one of the new-comers, asked a Court-Martial
upon a mutiny that had occurred just
before leaving the home port. St. Vincent at
first demurred, startled, according to Pellew's
biographer, by the extent of the plot then revealed,
and thinking it politic to suppress the
facts; but it is alleged with equal probability
that he was indignant at being continually called
upon to remedy evils due to the general indiscipline
of the Channel Fleet. "What do they
mean by invariably sending the mutinous ships
to me? Do they think that I will be hangman to
the fleet?" Both versions are likely enough to be
correct. There is a limit to all human endurance,
and the earl was now broken in health;
he was sixty-four, had borne his load for three
years, and was on the point of resigning his
command to Lord Keith. The Court, however,
was ordered, and three men were sentenced to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
hanged. Pellew then interceded for one, on
the ground of previous good character. "No,"
replied St. Vincent. "Those who have suffered
hitherto have been so worthless before that their
fate was of little use as an example. I shall
now convince the seamen that no character,
however good, shall save a man who is guilty of
mutiny."</p>

<p>But St. Vincent was not content with mere
repression. Outwardly, and indeed inwardly,
unshaken, he yet unwearyingly so ordered the
fleet as to avoid occasions of outbreak. With
the imposing moral control exerted by his unflinching
steadiness, little trouble was to be
apprehended from single ships; ignorant of what
might be hoped from sympathizers elsewhere,
but sure of the extreme penalty in case of failure,
the movements lacked cohesion and were easily
nipped. Concerted action only was to be feared,
and careful measures were taken to remove
opportunities. Captains were forbidden to entertain
one another at dinner,&mdash;the reason, necessarily
unavowed, being that the boats from
various ships thus assembling gave facilities for
transmitting messages and forming plans; and
when ships arrived from England they underwent
a moral quarantine, no intercourse with them
being permitted until sanctioned by the admiral.
When the captain reported to him, his boat,
while waiting, was shoved off out of earshot. It
is said that on one occasion a seaman in such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
a boat managed to call to one looking out of a
port of the flag-ship, "I say, there, what have you
fellows been doing out here, while we have been
fighting for your beef and pork?" To which the
other replied, "You'd best say nothing at all
about that out here, for if old Jarvie hears ye
he'll have ye dingle-dangle at the yardarm at
eight o'clock to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>The severe strain of this prolonged watchfulness
told on even his iron hardihood, and it would
almost appear that some of the rough practical
jokes told of this period must represent reaction
from the tension under which he necessarily was
through the grave anxieties pressing upon him.
Humor he certainly had, but at this time it often
showed itself in horse-play, so fantastic as to suggest
some unusual exciting cause. Thus, for one
such prank he seemed to draw his inspiration from
the Sunday celebration of Divine Service. Upon
its conclusion, he framed and published a new
signal, for "all chaplains," the employment of
which, however, was postponed to an occasion
suited to his lordship's fun. "A few days after it
blew great guns from west-southwest, which is
directly into the Bay of Cadiz. The inshore
squadron lay six miles from the flag-ship, directly
to leeward, and up went the signal for all chaplains.
It was a hard pull for the rowers, and no
luxury for the sitters. When they reached the
quarter-deck of the <i>Ville de Paris</i>, literally
drenched with salt-water, the admiral presented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
them to 'Bishop Morgan,' as he called the chaplain
of the flag-ship, and desired that they would
go down into the ward-room and hold a conclave."
One who has had a pull of that kind, as most officers
have in their day, can understand that the
humor was less appreciable to the victims than
to the author.</p>

<p>"He sometimes amused himself by paying a
visit to the quarter-deck at what most people
would deem very unseasonable hours. Coming
up one morning at half-past two, in the middle
watch, he sent for Colonel Flight, the commanding
officer of marines. Up came the colonel,
armed at all points, supposing that some enterprise
was in hand. 'I have sent for you,' said
the Chief, in the quiet and gentlemanly style
which he could always command, 'I have sent
for you, Colonel, that you might smell, for the
first time in your life, the delicious odors brought
off by the land wind from the shores of Andalusia.
Take a good sniff, and then you may go and turn
in again.'"</p>

<p>"A lieutenant one day came on board to
answer a signal. Lord St. Vincent thought
there was about him too much <i>embonpoint</i> for
an officer of that rank. 'Calder,' said he to the
captain of the fleet, 'all the lieutenants are running
to belly; they have been too long at anchor
(for the fleet was still off Cadiz); block up the
entering port, except for admirals and captains,
and make them climb over the hammocks.' The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
entering port in a three-decked ship being on
the middle deck, the difference between going
into that and climbing over the hammocks may
be compared to entering the drawing-room by
the balcony window, or mounting to the parapet
and taking the attics by storm. There was also
great inconvenience, and even expense, attending
this painful operation, since in those days all
officers wore white knee-breeches, or shorts, as
they were called, and many useful garments
which could not readily be replaced, were torn
and spoiled in this attempt at juvenile activity,
and many oaths probably sworn, which but for
this needless exertion would not have been
elicited."</p>

<p>A more pleasing, and it may well be believed
much more characteristic, instance of his playfulness
has also been transmitted; one illustrative
too of his deep fund of kindliness which was
shown in many acts, often of large pecuniary
liberality, and tinged especially with a certain
distinct service coloring, with sympathy for the
naval officer and the naval seaman, which must
have gone far to obtain for him the obedience
of the will as well as submission of conduct.
He wisely believed in the value of forms, and
was careful to employ them, in this crisis of the
mutinies, to enforce the habit of reverence for
the insignia of the state and the emblems of
military authority. Young lieutenants&mdash;for there
were <i>young</i> lieutenants in those days&mdash;were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
directed to stand cap in hand before their superiors,
and not merely to touch their hats in a
careless manner. "The discipline of the cabin
and ward-room officers is the discipline of the
fleet," said the admiral; and savage, almost, were
the punishments that fell upon officers who disgraced
their cloth. The hoisting of the colors,
the symbol of the power of the nation, from
which depended his own and that of all the
naval hierarchy, was made an august and imposing
ceremony. The marine guard, of near a
hundred men, was paraded on board every ship-of-the-line.
The national anthem was played,
the scarlet-clad guard presented, and all officers
and crews stood bareheaded, as the flag with
measured dignity rose slowly to the staff-head.
Lord St. Vincent himself made a point of attending
always, and in full uniform; a detail he did
not require of other officers. Thus the divinity
that hedges kings was, by due observance, associated
with those to whom their authority was
delegated, and the very atmosphere the seaman
breathed was saturated with reverence.</p>

<p>The presence of Lord St. Vincent on these
occasions, and in full uniform, gave rise to an
amusing skit by one of the lieutenants of the
fleet, attributing the homage exacted, not to the
flag, but to the great man himself; and this,
becoming known to the admiral, elicited from
him in turn the exhibition of practical humor to
which allusion has just been made. Parodying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
the Scriptural story of Nebuchadnezzar's golden
image, the squib began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I. The Earl of St. Vincent, the commander-in-chief,
made an Image of blue and gold, whose
height was about five feet seven inches, and the
breadth thereof was about twenty inches" (which
we may infer were the proportions of his lordship).
"He set it up every ten o'clock A.M. on
the quarter-deck of the <i>Ville de Paris</i>, before
Cadiz."</p>

<p>Passing from hand to hand, it can be understood
that this effusion, which was characterized
throughout by a certain sprightliness, gave more
amusement to men familiar with the local surroundings,
and welcoming any trifle of fun in the
dulness of a blockade, than it does to us. At
last it reached the admiral, who knew the author
well. Sending for him on some pretext, an hour
before the time fixed for a formal dinner to the
captains of the fleet, he detained him until the
meal was served, and then asked him to share it.
All passed off quietly until the cloth was removed,
and then the host asked aloud, "What shall be
done to the man whom the commander-in-chief
delights to honour?" "Promote him," said one
of the company. "Not so," replied St. Vincent,
"but set him on high among the people. So,
Cumby," addressing the lieutenant, "do you sit
there,"&mdash;on a chair previously arranged at some
height above the deck,&mdash;"and read this paper to
the captains assembled." Mystified, but not yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
guessing what was before him, Cumby took his
seat, and, opening the paper, saw his own parody.
His imploring looks were lost upon the admiral,
who sat with his stern quarter-deck gravity unshaken,
while the abashed lieutenant, amid the
suppressed mirth of his audience, stumbled
through his task, until the words were reached,
"Then the Earl of St. Vincent was full of fury,
and the form of his visage was changed against
the poor Captain of the Main-Top," who had not
taken off his hat before the Image of blue and
gold. Here a roar of laughter from the head of
the table unloosed all tongues, and Cumby's penance
ended in a burst of general merriment.
"Lieutenant Cumby," said the admiral, when
quiet was restored, "you have been found guilty
of parodying Holy Writ to bring your commander-in-chief
into disrespect; and the sentence is that
you proceed to England at once on three months'
leave of absence, and upon your return report to
me to take dinner here again."</p>

<p>Compelled by general break-down of health to
seek rest at home, St. Vincent returned to England
in August, 1799. He was not left long in
repose. The condition of the Channel Fleet as
regards discipline has already appeared, and the
very recent incident of the escape of the great
French fleet from Brest, coupled with the equally
humiliating and even more threatening experience
of the same character in 1796, when the invasion
of Ireland was attempted,&mdash;both which occurred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
under the same British commander-in-chief,&mdash;showed
the urgent necessity of placing in control
the only man of suitable rank, whose complete
adequacy to such a post had been demonstrated.
St. Vincent accordingly hoisted his flag in April,
1800.</p>

<p>In the effort to restore discipline, he here encountered
not only opposition, intensified by the
greater desire for shore privileges that always
attends a home station and the proximity of wives
and children, but something very like an attempt
at combination against his orders&mdash;a very grave
military offence&mdash;on the part of the captains.
All this he trampled down with severity amounting
to ruthlessness. The insubordinate toast&mdash;"May
the discipline of the Mediterranean never
be introduced into the Channel Fleet"&mdash;was
met face to face by republishing every order and
restriction upon which the discipline of the Mediterranean
had rested. In the more distinctly
military part of his task, the closing of the port
of Brest to evasions by the enemy, such as those
just mentioned, he achieved a noteworthy success.
Modelling his scheme upon that of Hawke, forty
years before, he gave to it a development, a
solidity, and an extension which his distinguished
forerunner had not been able to impart. Hawke
had not the advantage, which St. Vincent had, of
following a period of inefficiency, the remembrance
of which compelled the Admiralty vigorously to
support all measures of the commander-in-chief,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
if they desired to replace the interminable uncertainties
and anxieties of the last administration of
the fleet by a sense of security, and consequent
popular content.</p>

<p>St. Vincent's institution and maintenance of
the Brest blockade must be regarded under two
principal heads. There is, first, the usefulness of
the blockade as an instrument to the general
ends of the current war, which is the strategic
point of view, involving a conception permanent
in character; and there are again the local dispositions,
arising from the local conditions, that
may rightly be styled tactical, and vary from port
to port thus watched. The former, the strategic,
was more directly in line with his natural gifts;
and in the possession which the idea took of him
is to be found the germ of the system that thenceforward
began to throttle the power of the French
Revolution, whether under the Republic or the
Empire. The essence of the scheme was to cut
loose from the beach, and keep to the sea; ever
watchful, with the same watchfulness that had not
only crushed mutiny, but by diligent care forestalled
occasions of revolt. "Our great reliance,"
he said,&mdash;not directly in reference to the blockade,
but to the general thought of which the blockade,
as instituted by him, was the most illustrious
exemplification,&mdash;"is on the vigilance and activity
of our cruisers at sea, any reduction in the number
of which, by applying them to guard our ports, inlets,
and beaches, would in my judgment tend to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
our destruction." Amplified as the idea was by
him, when head of the Admiralty, to cover not only
Brest but all ports where hostile divisions lay, it
became a strategic plan of wide sweep, which
crushed the vitality of the hostile navies, isolated
France from all support by commerce, and fatally
sapped her strength. To St. Vincent, more than
to any one man, is due the effective enforcement
and maintenance of this system; and in this
sense, as practically the originator of a decisive
method, he is fairly and fully entitled to be considered
the organizer of ultimate victory.</p>

<p>The local dispositions before Brest will not
here be analyzed.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Suffice it to say that, as
revealed in Jervis's correspondence, they show that
equipment of general professional knowledge,
that careful study of conditions,&mdash;of what corresponds
to "the ground" of a shore battle-field,&mdash;and
the thoughtful prevision of possibilities,
which constitute so far the skilful
tactician. The defence and the attack of seaports,
embracing as they do both occupation of
permanent positions and the action of mobile
bodies, are tactical questions; differing much,
yet not radically, from field operations, where
positions are taken incidentally, but where movement
of armed men is the principal factor. In
the one sense St. Vincent displayed a high degree
of aptitude for ordered permanent dispositions,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>which is the side of tactics most akin to strategy.
On the more distinctively tactical side, in the
movements of a fleet in action, he had little
opportunity. As far as shown by his one battle,
Cape St. Vincent, it would not appear that either
by nature or cultivation he possessed to any great
extent the keen insight and quick appreciation
that constitute high tactical ability.</p>

<p>Earl St. Vincent rendered three great services
to England. The first was the forming and
disciplining the Mediterranean fleet into the perfection
that has been mentioned. Into it, thus
organized, he breathed a spirit which, taking its
rise from the stern commander himself, rested
upon a conviction of power, amply justified in
the sequel by Cape St. Vincent and the Nile,
its two greatest achievements. The second was
the winning of the Battle of St. Vincent at a most
critical political moment. The third was the suppression
of mutiny in 1797 and 1798. But, in estimating
the man, these great works are not to be
considered as isolated from his past and his future.
They were the outcome and fruitage of a character
naturally strong, developed through long
years of patient sustained devotion to the ideals
of discipline and professional tone, which in them
received realization. Faithful in the least, Jervis,
when the time came, was found faithful also in
the greatest. Nor was the future confined to
his own personal career. Though he must yield
to Nelson the rare palm of genius, which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
himself cannot claim, yet was the glory of Nelson,
from the Nile to Trafalgar, the fair flower
that could only have bloomed upon the rugged
stalk of Jervis's navy. Upon him, therefore, Nelson
showered expressions of esteem and reverence,
amounting at times almost to tenderness,
in his early and better days. In later years their
mutual regard suffered an estrangement which,
whatever its origin, appears as a matter of feeling
to have been chiefly on the part of the younger
man, whose temper, under the malign influence
of an unworthy passion, became increasingly imbittered,
at strife within itself and at variance with
others. The affectionate admiration of St. Vincent
for his brilliant successor seems to have remained
proof against external differences.</p>

<p>It was poetic justice, then, that allotted to St.
Vincent the arrangement of the responsible expedition
which, in 1798, led to the celebrated Battle
of the Nile; in its lustre and thorough workmanship
the gem of all naval exploits. To him
it fell to choose for its command his brilliant
younger brother, and to winnow for him the
flower of his fleet, to form what Nelson after the
victory called "his band of brothers." "The
Battle of the Nile," said the veteran admiral,
Lord Howe, "stands singular in this, that every
captain distinguished himself." The achievement
of the battle was Nelson's own, and Nelson's only;
but it was fought on St. Vincent's station, by a
detachment from St. Vincent's fleet. He it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
who composed the force, and chose for its leader
the youngest flag-officer in his command. Bitter
reclamations were made by the admirals senior
to Nelson, but St. Vincent had one simple sufficient
reply,&mdash;"Those who are responsible for
measures must have the choice of the men to
execute them."</p>

<p>When St. Vincent, in 1799, quitted the Mediterranean,
he had yet nearly a quarter of a
century to live. His later years were distinguished
by important services, but they embody
the same spirit and exemplify the same methods
that marked his Mediterranean command, which
was the culminating period of his career. In
1801, when Pitt's long term of office came to an
end, he became First Lord of the Admiralty,&mdash;the
head of naval affairs for the United Kingdom,&mdash;and
so continued during the Addington
administration, till 1804. In 1806, at the age of
seventy-two, he was again for a short time called
to command the Channel fleet; but in 1807 he
retired from active service, and the square flag
that had so long flown with honor was hauled
down forever.</p>

<p>The rest of his life was spent chiefly at his
country-seat, Rochetts, in Essex, sixteen miles
from London. Having a handsome income,
though not wealthy, he entertained freely; and
his retreat was cheered by frequent visits from
his old naval subordinates and political friends.
Generous in the use of money, and without chil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>dren
for whom to save, the neighborhood learned
to love him as a benefactor. In cases of necessity,
his liberality rose to profusion, and he
carried into the management of his estate a
carelessness he never showed in administering
a fleet. It is told that he once undertook to
raise a sum by mortgage, in entire forgetfulness
of a much larger amount in bank. Far
into old age he retained the active habits of
his prime. To say that he rose at four, asserts
a biographer, would be to understate the case;
he was frequently in the fields at half-past two
in the early summer dawn of England,&mdash;always
before his laborers,&mdash;and he was not pleased if
his male guests did not appear by six. To ladies
he was more tolerant. With mind unclouded
and unweakened to the last, he retained his interest
in public affairs and in the navy, contributing
to the conversation which animated his home the
judgment of an acute intellect, though one deeply
tinged by prejudices inseparable from so strong a
character. Thus honored and solaced by the
companionship of his friends, he awaited in calm
dignity the summons, which came on the 13th of
March, 1823. He was two months over eighty-eight
when he passed away, the senior admiral of
Great Britain.</p>

<p>James Saumarez was born on the 11th of
March, 1757, in Guernsey, one of the Channel
group of islands that still remain attached to the
English crown,&mdash;the sole remaining fragment of
the Norman duchy to which the kingdom itself
was for a while but an appendage. In Saumarez's
childhood, French was still so generally spoken
there that, despite the very early age at which
he went to sea, he always retained a perfect mastery
of that language; and it is recorded that
one of his uncles, being intended for the sea service,
was sent to school in England when ten
years old, in order to acquire the use of English.
From such a stock, whose lineage among the
gentry of the island can be traced to the fourteenth
century, sprang three distinguished officers
of this name, destined to illustrate the British
flag by their deeds in several wars, in which their
chief opponent was the French navy. Among
these, the subject of this article attained the most
brilliant renown. Eighteen months older than
Nelson, not even Nelson saw more or harder
fighting than did James Saumarez, nor bore
himself more nobly throughout their day and
generation.</p>

<p>Having early shown a taste for the navy, his
father, who had six sons and a restricted income,
obtained of a naval captain to have his name
borne on the books of a ship of war at the early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
age of ten; a curious custom of that day allowing
such constructive service to be counted in the
time prescribed for attaining a lieutenant's commission.
The boy did not actually go afloat
until 1770, when a little over thirteen. This first
employment kept him from home continuously
for five years, a period spent wholly in the Mediterranean,
and for the most part in the Levant;
the active naval war then existing between Turkey
and Russia, in the waters of Asia Minor,
necessitating a special protection to British interests.
It is a singular circumstance that this
sea, esteemed so important to Great Britain, was
never again visited by him, with the exception of
the few brief months from May to October, 1798,
when, as second in command, he followed Nelson's
flag during the pursuit of Bonaparte's fleet
which ended in its destruction at the Battle of the
Nile.</p>

<p>Returning to England in 1775, his actual and
constructive service permitted Saumarez to appear
for examination for a lieutenancy. This he
passed, but was not at once promoted. The
troubles with the American colonies had now become
open hostilities, and he was appointed, as
master's mate or passed midshipman, to the
<i>Bristol</i> of fifty guns, selected as flag-ship for
the expedition against Charleston. This duty,
which, by bringing him immediately under the
eyes of the naval commander-in-chief, placed him
also on the highway to advancement, he owed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Admiral Keppel, then one of the leading flag
officers of the British navy. His uncle, Philip
Saumarez, and Keppel had shared the perils and
sufferings of Anson's well-known expedition to
the South Seas in 1740. Together they had buffeted
the wild weather off Cape Horn, with ships'
companies more than decimated by scurvy; together
they had spread terror among the Spanish
colonies of the Pacific; together they had captured
the great galleon off Manila; and Keppel
still retained an affectionate interest in the kinsman
of his old shipmate, who had long since
fallen gloriously on the deck of his ship, in close
action with a French vessel of far superior force.</p>

<p>The squadron, which was commanded by Commodore
Sir Peter Parker, assembled at Cork,
whence it sailed in January, 1776. Embarked on
board the <i>Bristol</i> was Lord Cornwallis, afterwards
so closely, and for himself disastrously, associated
with the course of the American Revolution.
Struck by Saumarez's activity and efficiency, he
offered him a commission in his own regiment,
with the position of aide-de-camp to himself. The
young seaman, having a naturally strong military
bent, which at that moment seemed more
likely to receive satisfaction on shore than at sea,
and swayed doubtless also by the prospect of a
powerful patron, in the days when patronage had
so much to do with men's careers, was on the
point of accepting; but his messmates chaffed
him so mercilessly upon adopting a profession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
which habitually supplied them with derisive illustrations
and comparisons, that he finally declined.
Many years later, when Saumarez was among the
senior captains of the navy, the two gentlemen
met as guests at the table of the head of the Admiralty,
who upon hearing the incident from Cornwallis
remarked that he would have deprived the
navy of one of its best officers.</p>

<p>Owing partly to delays inseparable from sailing
vessels, and partly to the dilatoriness with which
war was most often waged before the days of the
French Revolution, the British expedition did
not appear off Charleston until the beginning of
June, 1776. To Americans who know their own
history, the stirring story of Fort Moultrie and
its repulse of the British fleet has been familiar
from childhood. Few are the American boys to
whom the names of Jasper, of Marion, and of
their brave commander, Moultrie himself, are unknown.
But while all honor is due to the band
of raw provincials who at this critical moment&mdash;one
week before the Declaration of Independence
was signed&mdash;withstood the enemy, and for the
moment saved the province, the steady, obstinate
valor shown by the seamen of kindred race, who
contended with them, was no less brilliant, and
was even more severely tested. The loss of the
fort was thirty-seven killed and wounded; that
of the <i>Bristol</i> alone was one hundred and eleven
out of a crew of three hundred and fifty; and
during much of the action, which lasted thirteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
hours, she was powerless to return the raking
fire of the enemy, in consequence of shot severing
the ropes that kept her broadside in position.
Saumarez was here for the first time engaged,
and had two narrow escapes. Once, when pointing
a gun, a cannon-ball entering the port swept
away seven of the eight men who served the
piece; and somewhat later another ball struck
off the head of a messmate by whom he was
standing, covering him with blood.</p>

<p>In this, his maiden action, Saumarez gave full
proof of the steady courage which ever distinguished
him; and it is worthy of passing
remark that, in the doggedness of the fighting
and the severity of the slaughter, the battle was
typical of a great part of his after experience.
Several death vacancies resulting among the
officers, he was promoted to be lieutenant a
fortnight later; and when the <i>Bristol</i> went north
he was again actively engaged in the operations
on Long Island, and along the East and Hudson
rivers, up to the evacuation of New York by the
Americans. His conspicuous activity at length
obtained for him the command of a galley, with
which he was sent to Rhode Island in February,
1778. The judgment of the illustrious Rodney,
as well as the repeated efforts of the Americans
to regain control of Narragansett Bay, may be
cited against the opinion expressed by Bancroft,
that the seizure of this important naval centre by
the British was a mistake. The tenure of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
island, however, depended upon the control of
the surrounding waters, and upon the active
destruction of the American means of transport.
Saumarez's galley was one of the force stationed
in the eastern, or Seakonnet, passage; and in the
five months thus employed it is recorded that he
was forty-seven times under fire.</p>

<p>Sullivan was at this time preparing for his
attack upon the British lines, expecting co-operation
by the French fleet. This arrived on the
29th of July, and six days later Seakonnet Channel
was entered by a detachment superior in force
to the British there. The latter burned their
ships and retreated to Rhode Island, where the
officers and seamen, Saumarez among them, continued
actively engaged in the defence of the
works. On August 8th, the main French fleet,
under the Count d'Estaing, ran the batteries of the
principal channel, and anchored off the north end
of the island, seriously increasing the perils of the
defenders; but next day the appearance of Lord
Howe with an inferior squadron lured the French
admiral out of the bay, his vessels were crippled
by a storm, and he abandoned the coast. Sullivan,
deprived of an essential factor in his
scheme, had then to fall back; and the British
captains, with their crews, being no longer needed,
returned to England to seek other ships.</p>

<p>Both by fortune and by choice, Saumarez's lot
throughout life was thrown with the line-of-battle
force of the navy, that body of heavy fighting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
ships which constitute the true backbone of a
sea service, because their essential function is to
fight, not singly, but in masses, co-operating with
others like themselves. In that respect they correspond
to the solid masses of infantry, which,
however disposed tactically, form the strength of
armies. The aptitudes of brilliant officers differ.
Some are born frigate-captains, partisan warriors,
ever actively on the wing, and rejoicing in the
comparative freedom and independence of their
movements, like the cavalry raider and outpost
officer. Of this type was Pellew, Lord Exmouth,
a seaman inbred, if ever there was one, who in
this sphere won the renown most distinctively
associated with his name, while giving proof
throughout a long career of high professional capacity
in many directions. But while Saumarez,
in his turn, was occasionally employed in frigate
and light cruiser service, and always with great
credit, his heart was with the ship-of-the-line,
whose high organization, steady discipline, and
decisive influence upon the issues of war appealed
to a temperament naturally calm, methodical, and
enduring. "He always preferred the command
of a ship-of-the-line to a frigate," says his biographer,
who knew him well,&mdash;"notwithstanding the
chances of prize-money are in favor of the latter;"
and he himself confirmed the statement, not only
by casual utterance,&mdash;"My station as repeating
frigate is certainly more desirable than a less conspicuous
one, at the same time I would rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
command a seventy-four,"&mdash;but by repeated formal
applications. In variety and interest of
operations, as well as in prize-money, did a cruising
frigate have advantages; for much of the
time of ships-of-the-line passed necessarily in
methodical routine and combined movements,
unfavorable to individual initiative. Nevertheless,
their functions are more important and more
military in character. In accordance with this
preference Saumarez is found, whether by his
own asking or not, serving the remaining three
years of his lieutenant's time upon vessels of that
class; and in one of them he passed through his
next general action, a scene of carnage little inferior
to the Charleston fight, illustrated by the
most dogged courage on the part of the combatants,
but also, it must be said, unrelieved by
any display of that skill which distinguishes
scientific warfare from aimless butchery. This,
however, was not Saumarez's fault.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1780, Great Britain, having
already France, Spain, and America upon her
hands, found herself also confronted by a league
between the Baltic states to enforce by arms
certain neutral claims which she contested. To
this league, called the Armed Neutrality, Holland
acceded, whereupon England at once declared war.
Both nations had extensive commercial interests
in the Baltic, and it was in protecting vessels
engaged in this trade, by a large body of ships of
war, that the only general action between the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
navies occurred. This was on the 5th of August,
1781, in the North Sea, off the Dogger-Bank,
from which it has taken its name.</p>

<p>At the time of meeting, the British, numbering
six ships-of-the-line, were returning from the
Baltic; the Dutch, with seven ships, were bound
thither. Despite the numerical difference, no
great error is made in saying that the two squadrons
were substantially of equal force. Each at
once ordered the merchant vessels under its protection
to make the best of their way towards
port, while the ships of war on either side began
to form in order of battle between the enemy and
their own convoy. The lists being thus cleared
and the lines ranged, the British vessels, which
were to windward, stood down together, after
what was then the time-honored and unintelligent
practice of their service, each to attack one of
the Dutch; disdaining to attempt doubling upon
any part of the hostile line. Their ideal appears
to have been that of the tournament, where every
advantage of numbers and combination was rejected
in order to insure that the test should be that
of individual courage and skill. So strong was this
tradition in the British navy that its ablest contemporary
chronicler, James, has sought to explain
away, half apologetically, the advantage gained by
Nelson in doubling on the French van at the
Nile.</p>

<p>The Dutch, equally quixotic, refrained from
taking advantage of the enemy's inability to use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
his broadsides while thus approaching nearly
head-on. Arrayed in a close column, the ships
about six hundred feet apart, the crews at the
guns, and the marines drawn up on the poops,
they waited in silence until the English, at
8 A.M., were in position at half musket shot.
Then the battle-flag was hoisted by each admiral,
and all opened together, the conflict raging with
fury for nearly four hours. It was the first time
since the days of the great De Ruyter, more than
a century before, that these kindred people had
thus met in fair fight upon the sea. Equal in
courage and in seamanship, and each neglecting
to seek a tactical advantage, the usual result followed.
Many men were killed and wounded, no
ship was taken, and the combatants separated
after a drawn battle; but as one Dutch ship sank
the next day, and their convoy could not proceed,
the British claimed a victory. Their own merchant
vessels, being on the return voyage, were
able to complete it.</p>

<p>Saumarez had shown his usual gallantry, and
was again promoted. On the 23d of August,
eighteen days after the action, he was made commander
into the <i>Tisiphone</i>, a small but fast
cruiser, technically called a fire-ship, and attached
to the Channel fleet. In December, the British
government learned that a large number of transports
and supply ships were about to sail from
Brest for the West Indies. These were to carry
troops and stores to the fleet of Count De Grasse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
who had returned to Martinique after the surrender
at Yorktown, and was now about to
undertake the conquest of Jamaica. It was imperative
to intercept an expedition so essential
to the success of the French plan, and Admiral
Kempenfelt&mdash;the same who afterwards, in the
<i>Royal George</i>, "went down with twice four hundred
men"&mdash;was sent in pursuit with twelve
ships-of-the-line. The <i>Tisiphone</i> accompanied
them as lookout vessel, and on the 12th of
December, 1781, being then well ahead of the
fleet, she was able to signal the admiral that the
enemy was in sight to leeward with seventeen of-the-line;
but that the latter, instead of being
between the British and the transports, were on
the far side. Kempenfelt, an able tactician as
well as seaman, seized his advantage, pushed
between the men-of-war and the convoy, and carried
off fifteen sail laden with military and naval
stores, of great money value and greater military
importance. More could not be done without
risking a battle with a too superior force. It
was essential, therefore, to apprise the British
commander in the West Indies of the approach
of the French reinforcements as well as of Kempenfelt's
successes, and the <i>Tisiphone</i> was the
same day despatched on this errand.</p>

<p>Although he knew it not, Saumarez was now
being borne by the tide which leads on to fortune.
The next step in promotion then fixed, and still
fixes, the seniority of a British officer, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
<i>Tisiphone's</i> mission led him straight to it.
Easily outsailing the unwieldy mass of enemies,
he reached Barbados, and there learned that the
British fleet, under Sir Samuel Hood, was anchored
off the island of St. Christopher, then
invaded by a French army supported by De
Grasse's fleet. The tenure of the island depended
upon a fort on Brimstone Hill, still held by the
British; and Hood, though much inferior in force,
had by a brilliant tactical move succeeded in
dislodging De Grasse from his anchorage ground,
taking it himself, and establishing there his fleet
in such order that its position remained impregnable.
The French, however, continued cruising
to the southward, off the adjoining island of
Nevis, where they interposed between Hood and
Saumarez; and the latter could reach his commander
only by threading the reefs lining the
passage between the two islands,&mdash;a feat considered
hazardous, if not impracticable. Nevertheless,
the <i>Tisiphone</i> effected it by diligent care
and seamanship, joining the fleet on January 31st,
1782.</p>

<p>Saumarez now found himself in the midst of the
most active operations, at the opening of a campaign
which promised to be of singular and
critical importance. But in the midst of his rejoicing
at the good fortune which had transferred
him from the comparative inactivity of the Channel
fleet, a momentary reverse befell. Called by
signal on board the flag-ship, he received a bag of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
despatches, with orders to sail that night for
England. As he went dejectedly down the ship's
side to his boat and was shoving off, the gig of
a post-captain pulled alongside. "Hallo, Saumarez,"
said its occupant, "where are you going?"
"To England, I grieve to say." "Grieve!" rejoined
the other. "I wish I were in your place.
I have been wanting this long time to go home
for my health. Hold on a moment; perhaps it can
be arranged." The new-comer, named Stanhope,
went at once to the admiral, who a few minutes
later sent for Saumarez. Hood had learned to
value the active young officer who had taken a
forward part in the guerilla enterprises of the
fleet. "Captain Saumarez," he said, "you know
not how much I wish to serve you. Captain
Stanhope shall go home, as he desires, and you
shall have command of the <i>Russell</i>." The same
night the <i>Tisiphone</i> sailed; Saumarez remaining
as an acting post-captain, with a ship of seventy-four
guns under him.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that two months later, at
the age of twenty-five, Saumarez commanded a
ship-of-the-line in Rodney's renowned battle of
the 12th of April; with one exception the most
brilliant and decisive action fought by the British
navy in a century. This circumstance alone
would have insured the confirmation of his rank
by the Admiralty, even had he not also eminently
distinguished himself; but it was for him one of
those periods when inconstant fortune seems bent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
upon lavishing her favors. He was near the
head of the British column, as the hostile
fleets passed in opposite directions, exchanging
broadsides. As his ship cleared the French rear,
a neighboring British vessel, commanded by one
of the senior captains, turned to pursue the
enemy. Saumarez gladly imitated him; but
when the other resumed his former course,
because the admiral of the van, his immediate
superior, had not turned, the <i>Russell</i>kept on after
the French. At this moment, Rodney in the
centre, and Hood in the rear, favored by a change
of wind, were breaking through the French line.
The <i>Russell's</i> course carried her toward them,
and consequently, in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> which followed,
she had the distinguished honor of engaging De
Grasse's flag-ship, and of being in action with her
when she surrendered. Indeed, although Saumarez
with characteristic modesty refrained from
pressing his claim, he always, when questioned
on the subject, maintained that although the
enemy's vessel certainly struck to Hood's flag-ship,
she did so immediately upon the latter
joining the <i>Russell</i>.</p>

<p>However regarded, this was a brilliant achievement
for so young a captain, less than a twelvemonth
having elapsed since he was but a
lieutenant. Rodney, who had meanwhile signalled
his van to go about, was somewhat perplexed
at finding a single ship thus opportunely
in the direction whence the <i>Russell</i> appeared;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
and, upon being informed that she belonged to
the van squadron, declared that her commander
had distinguished himself above all others in the
fleet. It proved, in fact, the keen military sense
of the demands of an occasion which constitutes
the born corps or division commander. This was
Saumarez's third general action, at a time when
Nelson, although three years a post-captain, had
commanded only frigates, and had never seen a
battle between fleets. But, if Saumarez used well
the singular opportunities with which fortune
favored him, it was characteristic of Nelson
that his value transpired through the simplest
intercourse and amid the most commonplace incidents
of service. Men felt, rather than realized,
that under the slight, quaint, boyish exterior there
lay the elements of a great man, who would one
day fulfil his own boast of climbing to the top of
the tree; and he had been made a full captain in
1779, when not quite twenty-one. According to
the rule of the British service, already mentioned,
this assured for life his precedence over Saumarez,
promoted in 1782.</p>

<p>The latter, however, if outstripped by a younger
competitor, who was to become the greatest of
British admirals, had secured a position of vantage
for that great war which then lay in the womb
of the future. Returning to England in 1782,
he passed in retirement the ten years that preceded
the outbreak of hostilities with the French
republic. During this period he was twice called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
out for service upon occasions of war threatening,&mdash;in
1787 with France, and in 1790 with Spain;
but though in each case appointed to a ship, the
employment went no farther, as hostilities were
timely averted. This protracted withdrawal from
active pursuit of his profession, viewed in connection
with his prolonged and efficient service of
the twenty following years, may be taken as indicating
two things: first, that to professional excellence
once attained such a break is not as
fatal as is commonly argued; and second, considered
with his favorable entertainment of Cornwallis's
proposal to exchange into the army, this
contentment with shore life during the peace
confirms the remark already made, that, although
a thorough seaman, Saumarez was so incidentally.
His quickening interest was in the military rather
than the nautical side of his calling. Pellew, on the
contrary, now eagerly sought duty at sea, impelled
thereto by clear restless predilection as well as,
possibly, by need of increased income. It was
during this interval of repose, in 1788, that Saumarez
married; a step which did not in his case
entail the professional deterioration charged
against it by the cynical criticisms of St. Vincent.
At this time, also, he made a trip to France, upon
the occasion of sinking the first cone of the great
Cherbourg breakwater, designed to give the
French navy a first-class arsenal upon the Channel,&mdash;a
purpose which it now fulfils. Louis
XVI. was present at this ceremony, and treated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
Saumarez with much attention. This was the
only time that he ever set foot upon French soil,
although his home was in sight of the coast and
he spoke the language fluently.</p>

<p>When war with France again began, in 1793,
Saumarez was appointed to the frigate <i>Crescent</i>,
of thirty-six guns, with which he served actively
in the Channel. In her, on the 20th of October,
1793, he succeeded in intercepting the French
frigate <i>R&eacute;union</i>, of substantially equal force,
which he had learned was in the habit of quitting
Cherbourg in pursuit of British merchant
vessels every night, returning in the morning.
The ensuing action called for an exhibition of
seamanship which showed he had not lost aptitude
during his retirement. In the beginning he
placed the <i>Crescent</i> on the weather quarter of the
French ship,&mdash;that is, on the windward side, but
a little to the rear. This was well judged, because
(1) the all-important rudder is thus less exposed,
(2) in case of an unfavorable accident the adversary
tends to leave rather than to approach, and (3)
the vessel, moving ahead, is at once under command
to stop short of the opponent. After being
placed, speed was regulated by backing or filling
the mizzen-topsail, thus maintaining the relative
positions, and directing fire upon the enemy's
rudder. In this situation the fore-topsail yard
and foretopmast of the <i>Crescent</i> were shot away
in quick succession, and the ship flew up head
to wind, bringing all her sails aback. For a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
moment she was in an awkward plight, but the
<i>R&eacute;union</i>, drawing away, could not rake; and Saumarez,
by adroit management of the rudder and
sails, <i>backed</i> his ship round,&mdash;always a nice operation
and especially when near an enemy,&mdash;till the
wind came again abaft, restoring the normal conditions
of moving ahead under control of the helm.
The contest was then renewed, and ended in the
surrender of the French vessel. The disparity of
loss&mdash;1 British to 118 French&mdash;proved the discipline
of the <i>Crescent</i> and the consummate seamanship
of her commander. For this exploit
Saumarez was knighted. Faithful to his constant
preference, he as soon as possible exchanged into
a ship-of-the-line, the <i>Orion</i>, of seventy-four guns.
In her he again bore a foremost part, in 1795, in
a fleet-battle off the Biscay coast of France,
where three enemy's ships were taken; and two
years later he was in the action with the Spaniards
off Cape St. Vincent, of which an account
has been given in the sketch of Earl St. Vincent.
After this Saumarez remained on the same station,
blockading Cadiz.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1798, it became necessary
to send a small detachment into the Mediterranean,
and off the chief arsenal of the enemy,
Toulon, to ascertain the facts concerning a great
armament, since known as Bonaparte's Egyptian
expedition, which rumor said was there in preparation.
The hazardous nature of the duty,
which advanced three ships of medium size, un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>supported,
in the very teeth of over a dozen
enemies, many of superior strength, demanded
the utmost efficiency in each member of the little
body so exposed; a consideration which doubtless
led Lord St. Vincent to choose Saumarez, though
one of the senior captains, for this service, of
which Nelson, the junior flag officer of the fleet,
was given charge.</p>

<p>It seems scarcely credible that, when it was
afterwards decided to raise this detachment to
fourteen ships-of-the-line, sufficient to cope with
the enemy, both St. Vincent and Nelson wished
to remove Saumarez, with his antecedents of
brilliant service, so as to allow Troubridge, his
junior, to be second in command. The fact, however,
is certain. Nelson had orders which would
have allowed him to send the <i>Orion</i> back, when
thus proceeding on a service pregnant with danger
and distinction, to the immeasurable humiliation
of her brave commander. After making every
deduction for the known partiality for Troubridge
of both St. Vincent and Nelson, it is difficult to
avoid the conclusion that Saumarez, with all his
undoubted merit, was in their eyes inferior to
Troubridge in the qualities necessary to chief
command, in case of Nelson's death, at a juncture
which called for the highest abilities of a general
officer. The moment was too critical to
permit mere favoritism to sway two such men
against their judgment. As it was, however,
Nelson felt he could not part with so efficient a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
ship; and he therefore contented himself with
giving Troubridge and Saumarez each a subdivision
of four vessels, keeping six under his
own immediate direction.</p>

<p>As all know, the French, when found, were at
anchor. Thus surprised, the British fleet was
hurled at them in a single mass; nor was there
any subordinate command exercised, by Saumarez
or any other, except that of each captain over his
particular ship. Nelson's first expectation was to
overtake the unwieldy numbers of the enemy,
amounting to over four hundred sail, at sea, and
there to destroy both convoy and escort. In such
an encounter there would be inestimable tactical
advantage in those compact subdivisions, which
could be thrown as units, under a single head, in
a required direction. For such a charge Saumarez
possessed most eminent capacity.</p>

<p>The warm family affection that was among the
many winning traits of Saumarez's symmetrical
and attractive character impelled him to copious
letter-writing. Hence we have a record of this
pursuit of the French fleet, with almost daily
entries; an inside picture, reflecting the hopes,
fears, and perplexities of the squadron. Bonaparte's
enterprise has been freely condemned
in later days as chimerical; but it did not so
appear at the time to the gallant seamen who
frustrated it. The preparations had been so
shrouded in mystery that neither Nelson nor his
government had any certainty as to its des<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>tination,&mdash;an
ignorance shared by most of the
prominent French officials. When, after many
surmises, the truth gradually transpired, the British
officers realized that much time must yet
elapse before the English ministry could know
it. Two months, for instance, passed before
news of the Battle of the Nile reached London.
Then, if India were the ultimate object, to which
Egypt was but the stepping-stone, four months
more, at least, would be needed to get a naval
reinforcement to the threatened point. What if,
meanwhile, the ally of France in the peninsula,
Tippoo Saib, had been assembling transports
with the secrecy observed at Toulon and the
other ports whence the divisions had sailed? "I
dined with Sir Horatio to-day," writes Saumarez
on June 15th, nearly four weeks after Bonaparte's
starting, "and find that his intelligence extends
only to the enemy's fleet having been seen off
Sicily; but we have reason to suppose them
gone for Alexandria, the distance from which to
the Red Sea is only three days' journey. They
may soon be transported thence by water to the
East Indies, with the assistance of Tippoo Saib;
and with their numerous army they expect to
drive us out of our possessions in India. This
profound scheme, <i>which is thought very feasible</i>,
we hope to frustrate by coming up with them
before they reach the place of their destination."
A week later, Nelson received off Sicily news
of the surrender of Malta to the French. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
accordance with the views above expressed, Sir
James now&mdash;June 22d&mdash;gave Nelson his written
opinion, favoring the course adopted of seeking
the enemy off the coast of Egypt; one of the
most responsible decisions ever taken by an admiral
in chief command, especially at the beginning
of a career, as Nelson then was. "We are
now crowding sail for Alexandria; but it is very
doubtful if we fall in with them at all, as we are
proceeding on the merest conjecture, and not on
any positive information. If, at the end of our
journey, we find we are upon the wrong scent,
our embarrassment will be great indeed. Fortunately,
I only act here <i>en second</i>; but did the
chief responsibility rest with me, I fear it would
be more than my too irritable nerves would bear."
Nelson, in truth, was passing these hours in a
fever of anxiety, scarce able to eat or drink. Yet
at that very moment the British were crossing
the enemy's wake, unseeing and unseen, and
barely fifty miles separated the two fleets.</p>

<p>The perplexity foreshadowed by Saumarez actually
fell upon the English admiral, through his
reaching Alexandria three days before the French.
Harassed out of his better judgment, he hurried
back to the westward, touched at Sicily, and
thence once more to Egypt. Meantime, the
French had landed successfully. On the 1st of
August the British fleet again sighted Alexandria;
saw the French flag on the walls, but no
ships of war. "When the reconnoitring squad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>ron
made the signal that the enemy was not
there," wrote Saumarez, "despondency nearly
took possession of my mind, and I do not remember
ever to have felt so utterly hopeless or
out of spirits as when we sat down to dinner.
Judge, then, what a change took place when, as
the cloth was being removed, the officer of the
watch hastily came in, saying, 'Sir, a signal is
just now made that the enemy is in Aboukir Bay,
and moored in a line of battle.' All sprang from
their seats, and, only staying to drink a bumper
to our success, we were in a moment on deck."
As the captain appeared, the crew hailed him
with three hearty cheers, a significant token of
the gloom which had wrapped the entire squadron
through the recent ordeal of suspense and disappointment.</p>

<p>It is only with Saumarez's share in this renowned
battle that we are here concerned. As
is generally known, Nelson's tactics consisted in
doubling upon the van and centre of the enemy,
who lay at anchor in a column head to wind,
or nearly so. Their rear, being to leeward, was
thus thrown out of action. The French had
thirteen ships-of-the-line, of which one was of
one hundred and twenty guns, and two eighties.
The British also had thirteen, all seventy-fours,
and one of fifty guns; but one of the former
going aground left them equal in numbers and
inferior in force. There were two successive
acts in the drama. In the first, ten British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
ships engaged the eight leading French; in
the second, the fifty and two of the seventy-fours,
which had been belated, came upon the field
and strengthened the attack upon the enemy's
centre. The <i>Orion</i>, being third in the order,
was one of the five vessels which passed within
the French, and fought on that side. In so doing,
she described a wide sweep around her two predecessors.
While thus standing down to her
station, an enemy's frigate, the <i>S&eacute;rieuse</i>, opened
fire upon her, wounding two men. It was then
part of the chivalrous comity of fleet-actions that
frigates should not be molested by the ships-of-the-line,
so long as they minded their own business,&mdash;an
immunity which of course ceased if
they became aggressive. Saumarez was urged to
return her fire. "No," he replied, "let her alone;
she will get bolder and come nearer. Shorten
sail." She did draw nearer, and then the <i>Orion</i>,
swinging sharply towards her, let drive her broadside
of double-shotted guns. All the masts of
the unlucky frigate went overboard, and she
shortly sank, nothing but her poop being visible
the next day. The helm of the British vessel was
then shifted, but so much ground had been lost
that she could anchor only abreast the fifth
French ship; the interval left being filled by
those who followed. In this position the <i>Orion</i>
silenced her immediate opponent, the <i>Peuple
Souverain</i>, which, being in an hour and a half totally
dismasted, cut her cables and dropped out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
the line; the contest being then continued with
the sixth in the French order, the <i>Franklin</i>,
next ahead of the flag-ship, <i>Orient</i>. The <i>Orion</i>
was thus near by the latter when she blew up,
but the few burning fragments which fell on
board were quickly extinguished.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours after the battle, Saumarez,
who had been delayed till then by a severe
wound from a splinter, went on board the flag-ship
to call on the admiral; and to this visit we
owe the knowledge of two closely related incidents,
recorded by his biographer and friend,
which are significant at once of his individual
ideas on tactical combination, and of the lack of
personal sympathy apparent between him and
Nelson. He "found several of his brother officers
on the quarter-deck, discussing the merits of
the action. Some regret having been expressed
at the escape of the two sternmost ships of the
French line, Sir James said to the admiral, 'It
was unfortunate we did not&mdash;' and was proceeding
to say 'all anchor on the same side.' But,
before he could finish the sentence, Nelson
hastily interrupted him, exclaiming, 'Thank God
there was no order!' Then turning the conversation,
he entered his cabin and sent for Captain
Ball.... We may relate the circumstances which
induced Saumarez, without the least intention to
offend, to make the observation at which offence
was taken. It was Nelson's custom, when in communication
or company with the captains under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
his command, to converse with them on the various
modes of attacking the enemy under different
circumstances; and, on one of these occasions,
Sir James Saumarez, who had seen the evil consequences
of <i>doubling</i> on the enemy, especially in
a night action, had differed with the admiral in
that plan of attack, saying that 'it never required
two English ships to capture one French, and
that the damage which they must necessarily do
each other might render them both unable to fight
an enemy's ship that had not been engaged;
and, as in this case two ships could be spared
to the three-decker, everyone might have his
opponent.'"</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Nelson, in pursuance of his previously
announced idea, had himself in the flag-ship&mdash;the
sixth to enter action&mdash;set the example of
<i>doubling</i>, by anchoring on the side of the enemy's
line opposite to that of his first five ships, and in
doing so had deliberately taken position on one
side of a French vessel already engaged on the
other, Saumarez's remark was substantially a
censure, inopportune to a degree singular in a
man of his kindly and generous temper; and its
reception by Nelson is not a cause for surprise.
On the other hand, as a matter of tactical criticism,
based upon tactical conceptions previously
adopted, if we assume it to be true that two
British ships were not needed to capture one
French, it may yet be confidently affirmed that
to attack with decisively superior force a part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
of the enemy's order&mdash;to combine in short&mdash;is
shown by experience to attain the same degree of
success more certainly and at less cost than the
simple distribution of effort advocated by Saumarez.
To double, and to beat in detail, remained the
ideal of Nelson, as it had been of Howe. It was
by him applied then and afterwards to all cases,
small or great, actual or supposed. To it he
chiefly owed his dazzling successes, and this
divergence of ideals marks the difference in
professional insight which mainly determines
the relative positions of Nelson and Saumarez
in naval biography. It indicates the distinction
between the great general officer and the accomplished
and resolute division or corps commander.</p>

<p>At the Battle of the Nile Saumarez received
the only wound that ever fell to him throughout
his numerous meetings with the enemy, being
struck on the thigh and side by a heavy splinter,
which had killed two officers before reaching him.
The total loss of his ship was forty-two killed and
wounded, out of a crew of six hundred. Ten
days after the action he was ordered to take
charge of six of the prizes, which had been partly
repaired, and with seven of the fleet to convoy
them to Gibraltar. At the same time he was
notified that the <i>Orion</i> was to go home as soon
as this duty was performed. A more charming
prospect can scarcely be imagined than this returning
to his family after a long absence, fresh
from the completest achievement ever wrought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
by the British navy; but even his tranquil temper,
whose expressions never lapse into the
complaints of Nelson or the querulousness of
Collingwood, was tried by the slow progress of
his battered and crippled squadron. "The prizes
get on very slowly," he writes; "but I am endowed
with unparalleled patience, having scarcely
uttered a murmur at their tardiness, so perfectly
satisfied am I with the prospect before me."
Some time later he notes: "We have been three
weeks effecting what might be accomplished in
two days. This extraordinary delay makes me
more fractious than can be imagined, and I begin
to lose the character for patience which I had given
myself, by so tiresome a situation." It was still
the season of westerly winds, and the voyage from
Alexandria to Gibraltar occupied sixty-nine days.</p>

<p>The <i>Orion</i> was now completely worn out, having
been continuously in commission since the
war began in 1793. Besides the three general
actions in which Saumarez commanded her, she
had borne a valiant part in Howe's great battle of
the 1st of June. "This last business has so
shattered the poor <i>Orion</i>" wrote Saumarez, "that
she will not, without considerable repairs, be in a
state for more service." On reaching England
she was paid off; and in February, 1799, he
was appointed to the <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, of eighty-four guns,
one of the finest ships in the navy, which was to
bear his flag in the last and most brilliant episode
of his hard-fighting career.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<p>A year later, Lord St. Vincent, having returned
from the Mediterranean, took command
of the Channel Fleet, and at once instituted in
its methods, and particularly in the blockade of
Brest, changes which gradually revolutionized the
character of the general naval war; baffling beyond
any other single cause the aims of Napoleon,
and insuring the fall of his empire. One
of the new requirements was the maintenance of
a powerful advanced division of six or eight ships-of-the-line,
within ten miles of the harbor's mouth.
It was a duty singularly arduous, demanding
neither dash nor genius, but calmness, steadiness,
method, and seamanship of a high order, for all
which Saumarez was conspicuous. From either
side of the Bay of Brest a long line of reefs projects
for fifteen miles to the westward. Far inside
their outer limits, and therefore embayed by
the westerly winds which blow at times with
hurricane violence, was the station of the advanced
squadron, off some well-marked rocks of
the northern reef, known as the Black Rocks.
On this spot, called Siberia by the seamen, during
fifteen weeks, from August to December, Sir
James Saumarez kept so close a watch that not a
vessel of any force entered or left Brest. "With
you there," wrote Earl St. Vincent, "I sleep as
sound as if I had the key of Brest in my pocket."
No work ever done by him was more meritorious
or more useful. Near its expiration St. Vincent
wrote to him, "The employment you have con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>ducted
is the most important of this war." He there
demonstrated that what before had apparently been
thought impossible could be done, though involving
a degree of anxiety and peril far exceeding
that of battle, while accompanied by none of the
distinction, nor even recognition, which battle
bestows. "None but professional men who have
been on that service," says his biographer with
simple truth, "can have any idea of its
difficulties,&mdash;surrounded by dangers of every kind,
exposed to the violence of storms, sailing amidst
a multitude of rocks and variable currents in the
longest and darkest nights, and often on a lee shore
on the enemy's coast, while the whole of their fleet
is near, ready to take advantage of any disaster."
Collingwood, who in the next war succeeded
to the same unenviable duty, wrote home that,
even in the summer month of August, "I bid
adieu to comfortable naps at night, never lying
down but in my clothes. An anxious time I
have of it, what with tides and rocks, which
have more of danger in them than a battle once
a week." In this laborious task Saumarez was
the patient, unobserved pioneer.</p>

<p>There was one man, however, who could and
did recognize to the full the quality of the work
done by Saumarez, and its value to those sagacious
plans which he himself had framed, and
which in the future were to sap the foundations
of the French power. That man was St. Vincent.
"The merit of Sir James Saumarez," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
said, "cannot be surpassed;" and again, to Saumarez
himself, "The manner in which you have
conducted the advanced squadron calls upon me
to repeat my admiration of it." Succeeding soon
after to the post of First Lord of the Admiralty,
he gave him an opportunity for distinction, which
resulted in an action of singular lustre and striking
success.</p>

<p>Bonaparte, long before returned from Egypt,
and now, as First Consul, practically the absolute
ruler of France, had overthrown all enemies
on the Continent. Peace with Austria, after
her disasters of Marengo and Hohenlinden, had
been signed in February, 1801. The great objects
of the French ruler now were to compass
a maritime peace and withal to retain Egypt,
associated from far back with the traditional
policies of France, and moreover a conquest in
which his own reputation was peculiarly interested.
To compel Great Britain to peace, he
sought, by diplomacy or force, to exclude her
commerce from the Continent, as well as to
raise up maritime enemies against her. Thus
he had fostered, if not actually engendered, the
Baltic league of 1801, shattered by Nelson at
Copenhagen; and for this purpose he intended
to occupy both Portugal and the kingdom of
Naples. A powerful British expedition against
Egypt had entered the Mediterranean. It was
essential either to attack this directly, or to cripple
its communications. Unable to do the for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>mer,
and persistently thwarted in his attempts
to reinforce his own troops in that distant dependency
by the close watch of the British navy,
of which Saumarez gave so conspicuous an illustration
before Brest, Napoleon resorted to the
common and sound military expedient of collecting
a threatening force upon the flank of
his enemy's line of communications. He directed
a concentration of the Spanish and French navies
at Cadiz, which, by its nearness to the straits,
met the desired requirement. Among others,
three French ships were ordered thither from
Toulon.</p>

<p>The British ministry was informed that at Cadiz
were collecting Spanish vessels, said by report
to be intended against Portugal. This is unlikely,
as Bonaparte could have subdued that country
from the land side by the assistance of Spain;
moreover, the object of the concentration is stated
in his letters. A squadron of five ships-of-the-line
was accordingly formed, and placed under
the command of Saumarez, who on the 1st of
January, 1801, had been made a rear admiral. His
orders were to go off Cadiz, where he would find
two more vessels, and to prevent the enemies
within the port from sailing, or from being joined
by any from outside. Whatever Bonaparte's
object, it would be thwarted by a force thus interposed,
in a position to meet either one or the
other of the converging detachments before they
could unite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>Saumarez sailed on his mission June 16, 1801,
and on the 28th arrived off Cadiz. On the 5th
of July he was informed that three French ships
had anchored off Algeciras, the Spanish port on
the west side of Gibraltar Bay, confronting the
British fortress on the east side. This was the
division from Toulon, which upon reaching
the straits first learned of the British squadron
that effectually prevented its entrance to Cadiz.</p>

<p>Saumarez at once started for Algeciras with
six of his ships-of-the-line, the seventh being
out of recall to the northward. The following
day, July 6th, he entered the bay, and found the
French moored in a strong position, under cover
of Spanish land batteries, and supported by a
number of gunboats. Still, though difficult and
doubtful, the enterprise was not hopeless; and,
as the breeze allowed his vessels to head for
the enemy, he steered to engage at once. Unfortunately,
the wind fell as the squadron drew
nigh, and only four ships were able to take
their intended places; the other two had to anchor
outside their consorts, and fire as they
could through the intervals. This mishap lessened
by one-third the fighting power of the
British, and, coupled with the acknowledged superiority
of guns on solid ground over those
afloat, reduced them to inferiority. Their disadvantage
was increased by the arrangements of
the French admiral, carefully elaborated during
the two preceding days. Had the preparations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
of Brueys at the Nile equalled those of Linois at
Algeciras, Nelson's task must have been harder
and his victory less complete. Nevertheless, after
an engagement of an hour and a half, the British
fire so far prevailed that the enemy resorted to a
measure for which precautions had been taken
beforehand. Lines had been run from each French
ship to the shoal water lying close inside them;
and by means of these they were warped away
from their opponents until they took the ground.
This increase of distance was in every way a gain
to the party standing on the defensive, and a corresponding
loss to the assailants. Saumarez ordered
the cables cut and sail made to close once more;
but the light and fickle airs both baffled this effort
and further embarrassed the British, through
the difficulty of keeping their broadsides in position.
Here happened the great disaster of the day.
One of the outer ships, the <i>Hannibal</i>, tried to pass
inside the headmost of the French, not realizing
that the latter had moved. In so doing she
ran aground close under a battery, to whose
fire she could make no reply. After a brave and
prolonged resistance, in which she lost seventy-five
killed and seventy wounded out of a crew
of six hundred, and had many of her guns dismounted,
she hauled down her flag. By this
time another ship, the <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i>, was dismasted,
and success was plainly hopeless. The British
admiral, therefore, ordered the action discontinued,
and withdrew to the Gibraltar side;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
the <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i> having to be towed away by the
boats of the squadron.</p>

<p>Saumarez had failed, and failure, however explained,
can hardly be carried to a man's credit;
but his after course, by wresting success out of
seemingly irretrievable disaster, has merited the
highest eulogium. Maintaining both courage
and energy unimpaired, every effort was instantly
made to get the ships once more into fighting
condition, that the attack might be renewed.
"Tell the Admiralty," said he to the bearer of
his despatches, "that I feel confident I shall soon
have an opportunity of attacking the enemy again,
and that they may depend upon my availing
myself of it."</p>

<p>The opportunity did come. On the morning
of July 9th, the <i>Superb</i>, the seventh ship, which
had not been in the action, was seen rounding
the west point of the bay under all sail, with
a signal flying that the enemy was in pursuit.
A few moments later appeared five Spanish
vessels, two of which, the <i>Real Carlos</i> and the
<i>Hermenegildo</i>, carrying each one hundred and
twelve guns, were among the largest then afloat.
On board them had embarked a number of the
<i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i> of Cadiz, eager to join the triumphal
procession which it was thought would soon
enter the port, flushed with a victory considered
by them to be rather Spanish than French, and
escorting the rare trophy of a British ship-of-the-line
that had struck to Spanish batteries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
Besides the two giants, there were a ninety-gun
ship and two seventy-fours; and the next day a
French vessel of the latter class joined, making a
total reinforcement of six heavy ships.</p>

<p>To these Saumarez could oppose but five.
The <i>Hannibal</i> he had lost. The <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i> could
not be repaired in time; her people were therefore
distributed among the other vessels of the
squadron. Even his own flag-ship, the <i>C&aelig;sar</i>,
was so injured that he thought it impossible to
refit her; but when her crew heard his decision,
one cry arose,&mdash;to work all day and night till
she was ready for battle. This was zeal not according
to knowledge; but, upon the pleading of
her captain in their name, it was agreed that they
should work all day, and by watches at night.
So it happened, by systematic distribution of
effort and enthusiastic labor, that the <i>C&aelig;sar</i>,
whose mainmast on the 9th was out and her rigging
cut to pieces, was on the 12th able to sail in
pursuit of the foe.</p>

<p>During the forenoon of the latter day the
combined squadron was seen getting under way.
The wind, being easterly, was fair for the British,
and, besides, compelled the enemy to make some
tacks to clear the land. This delay was invaluable
to Saumarez, whose preparations, rapid as
they had been, were still far from complete. Not
till one in the afternoon did the headmost Spaniards
reach the straits, and there they had to
await their companions. The <i>Hannibal</i> was un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>able
to join them, and reanchored at Algeciras.
At half-past two the <i>C&aelig;sar</i> hauled out from Gibraltar
mole, her band playing, "Cheer up, my
lads, 't is to glory we steer!" which was answered
from the mole-head with "Britons, strike home!"
At the same moment Saumarez's flag, provisionally
shifted to another vessel, was rehoisted at her
masthead. The rugged flanks of the rock and
the shores of Algeciras were crowded with eager
and cheering sight-seers, whose shouts echoed
back the hurrahs of the seamen. Rarely, indeed,
is so much of the pride and circumstance, if not
of the pomp, of war rehearsed before an audience
which, breathless with expectation, has in it no
part save to admire and applaud.</p>

<p>Off Europa Point, on the Gibraltar side, there
clustered round the <i>C&aelig;sar</i> her four consorts,
all but one bearing, like herself, the still fresh
wounds of the recent conflict. Four miles away,
off Cabrita Point, assembled the three French of
Linois's division, having like honorable marks,
together with the six new unscarred arrivals. At
8 P.M. of the summer evening the allies kept
away for Cadiz; Linois's division leading, the
other six interposing between them and the five
ships of Saumarez, which followed at once. It
was a singular sight, this pursuit of nine ships
by five, suggestive of much of the fatal difference,
in ideals and efficiency, between the navies
concerned. Towards nine o'clock Saumarez ordered
the <i>Superb</i>, whose condition alone was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
unimpaired by battle, to press ahead and bring
the rear of the enemy to action. The wind was
blowing strong from the east, with a heavy sea.
At half-past eleven the <i>Superb</i> overtook the <i>Real
Carlos</i>, and opened fire. Abreast the Spanish
vessel, on her other side, was the <i>Hermenegildo</i>.
The latter, probably through receiving some of
the <i>Superb's</i> shot, fancied the ship nearest her to
be an enemy, and replied. In the confusion, one
of them caught fire, the other ran on board her,
and in a few moments there was presented to the
oncoming British the tremendous sight of these
two huge ships, with their twenty hundred men,
locked in a fast embrace and blazing together.
At half-past two in the morning, having by
that time drifted apart, they blew up in quick
succession.</p>

<p>Leaving them to their fate, the hostile squadron
passed on. The <i>Superb</i> next encountered
the <i>St. Antoine</i>, and forced her to strike. Soon
afterwards the wind died away, and both fleets
were much scattered. A British ship brought
to action one of the French which had been
in the first battle; indeed, the French accounts
say that the latter had fought three enemies.
However that may be, she was again severely
mauled; but the English vessel opposed to her
ran on a shoal, and lost all her masts. With this
ended the events of that awful night.</p>

<p>The net results of this stirring week completely
relieved the fears of the British ministers. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>ever
the objects of the concentration at Cadiz,
they were necessarily frustrated. Though the
first attack was repulsed, the three French ships
had been very roughly handled; and, of the relieving
force, three out of six were now lost to the
enemy. "Sir James Saumarez's action has put
us upon velvet," wrote St. Vincent, then head of
the Admiralty; and in the House of Peers he
highly eulogized the admiral's conduct, as also
did Nelson. The former declared that "this gallant
achievement surpassed everything he had
ever met with in his reading or service," a statement
sufficiently sweeping; while the praise of the
hero of the Nile was the more to be prized because
there never was cordial sympathy between
him and Saumarez. Closely as they had been
associated, Nelson's letters to his brother officer
began always "My dear Sir James," not "My
dear Saumarez."</p>

<p>In this blaze of triumph the story of Saumarez
fitly terminates. He was never again engaged in
serious encounter with the enemy. The first war
with the French republic ended three months
after the battle of Algeciras. After the second
began, in 1803, he was, until 1807, commander-in-chief
at the Channel Islands, watching the
preparations for the invasion of England, and
counteracting the efforts of cruisers against British
commerce. In 1808, in consequence of the
agreements of Tilsit between the Czar and Napoleon,
affairs in the Baltic became such as to de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>mand
the presence of a large British fleet,&mdash;first
to support Sweden, then at war with Russia, and
later to protect the immense British trade, which,
under neutral flags and by contraband methods,
maintained by way of the northern sea the intercourse
of Great Britain with the Continent. Of
this trade Sweden was an important intermediary,
and her practical neutrality was essential to its
continuance. This was insured by the firm yet
moderate attitude of Sir James Saumarez, even
when she had been forced by France to declare
war against Great Britain.</p>

<p>It may be said without exaggeration that from
this time, and until the breach between Napoleon
and Russia in 1812, the maritime interest of the war
between Great Britain and France centred in the
Baltic. Elsewhere the effective but monotonous
blockade of the continental ports controlled by
the French Emperor absorbed the attention of
the British fleets. Of great battles there were
none after Trafalgar. To Saumarez, therefore,
fell the most distinctive, and probably also the
most decisive, field of work open to the British
navy. The importance of the Baltic was twofold.
It was then the greatest source of materials
essential to ship-building&mdash;commonly called
naval stores; and further, the Russian part of its
coast line, being independent of Napoleon's direct
regulation, was the chief means of approach by
which Great Britain maintained commercial intercourse
with the Continent, to exclude her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
from which had become the leading object with
the Emperor. The contravention of his policy in
this way, in disregard, as he claimed, of the agreements
existing between him and the Czar, led
eventually to the Russian war, and so finally to
his own overthrow and the deliverance of the
Continent from his domination.</p>

<p>The historical significance of the position now
occupied by Saumarez, and its importance to the
great issues of the future, are thus manifest. It
was a post that he was eminently qualified to fill.
Firm, yet calm, sagacious, and moderate, he met
with rare efficiency the varied and varying demands
of those changeful times. The unremitting
and well directed efforts of his cruisers broke
up reciprocal commerce between the countries
surrounding the narrow inland sea, so essential
to their welfare while submitting to Napoleon;
while the main fleet sustained the foreign trade
with Russia and Sweden, carried on through
neutral ships for the advantage of Great Britain.
Two instances will illustrate his activities better
than many words. In the year 1809 four hundred
and thirty local vessels were captured, averaging
the small size of sixty tons each, three hundred
and forty of which belonged to Denmark, then
under Napoleon's absolute sway. At the close of
the open season of 1810, the merchant ships for
England, which ordinarily were despatched under
convoy in bodies of five hundred, numbered,
according to Saumarez's flag-lieutenant and biog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>rapher,
no less than one thousand vessels, gathered
in one mass.</p>

<p>As long as Sweden remained friendly, the
admiral's duties, though weighty, did not differ
materially from those usual to his profession; but
when she was unwillingly forced into a declaration
of war by Napoleon, his task became more
complicated and more delicate. The British
minister having to leave, Saumarez succeeded to
a diplomatic situation, in which the problem was
to support the interests and dignity of his own
nation, without transforming the formal war into
actual hostilities, and substituting imbitterment
for the secret good will of the Swedish government
and people, who, in common with the
Russian nobles and subjects, were alienated by
the imperious and merciless exactions of the
French demands. The secret aim of Great Britain
was so to nourish this ill-will towards France, and
so to avoid causes of offence by herself, as to
convert covert hostility into open antagonism,
and thus to reverse the political and military combinations
of Europe. In the absence of regular
accredited diplomatic representatives, Saumarez
became at once the exponent and the minister of
this vital policy. He had to avoid quarrels, and
yet at the same time to restrain Sweden from acts
of injury to which she was constantly impelled
by the Emperor, whose purpose naturally was
exactly the opposite of his; and who sought further
to estrange all people from Great Britain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p>In the performance of this task Saumarez's
success was not only complete, but peculiarly his
own. His temper was at times severely tried,
but it never got beyond his control. He repressed
injury, and demanded satisfaction for it, when
committed; but, relying with good reason on the
motives of the Swedish government, he contrived
to secure redress without resorting to force, which,
however understood by statesmen, would enrage
the peoples he had to conciliate. After the ordeal
was over, and Russia was at war with France, a
leading Swedish statesman wrote to him: "You
have been the guardian angel of my country; by
your wise, temperate, and loyal conduct, you have
been the first cause of the plans which have been
formed against the demon of the continent....
Once more I must tell you, that <i>you</i> were the
first cause that Russia had dared to make war
against France; had you fired one shot when we
declared war against England, all had been ended
and Europe would have been enslaved." Saumarez,
an extremely religious man, may have
reflected that "he who ruleth his spirit is greater
than he that taketh a city."</p>

<p>Though in the strictest sense professional, the
Baltic service of Saumarez involved little of purely
military interest. Shortly after his assuming the
command, in 1808, a Russian fleet which had
been keeping the sea took refuge, on the
approach of the allied British and Swedes, in a
harbor on the Gulf of Finland. Saumarez fol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>lowed
close upon their heels, and after a consultation
and reconnoissance of the position, which
consumed two days, secured the co-operation of
the Swedish admiral for an attack on the day
following; an essential condition, for the Russian
force was superior to his own in the proportion of
eight to six. Unhappily, the wind shifted, and
blew an adverse gale for eight days; at the end
of which time the enemy had so far fortified the
surroundings that Saumarez thought it inexpedient
to attack. In this decision he was supported
by the opinion of captains of such established
reputation as, joined to his own brilliant record,
must be taken to justify his action, which seems
to have caused some dissatisfaction in England.
On the face, it could not but be a disappointment
to people accustomed to the brilliant victories of
Nelson, and his apparent invincibility by obstacles;
but in the end it was all for the best, for doubtless
the mortifying destruction of a Russian fleet
would not have furthered the reconciliation, which
soon became a leading object with the British
government and the great bulk of the Russian
nation. It is, however, probable that to this
frustration of public expectation, which had been
vividly aroused by preceding accounts of the conditions,
is to be attributed the delay in granting
the peerage, eagerly desired by Saumarez in his
later days,&mdash;not for itself merely, but as a recognition
which he not unnaturally thought earned
by his long and distinguished service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
Saumarez held the Baltic command through
five eventful years,&mdash;from 1808 to 1812. After
Napoleon's disastrous Russian expedition, affairs
in that sea no longer required a force adequate to
his rank, and he then finally retired from service
afloat, still in the full maturity of a healthy prime,
at the age of fifty-five. The remainder of his life,
with brief exception, was passed in his native
island of Guernsey, amid those charms of family
affection and general esteem which he had deserved
by his fidelity to all the duties of the man
and the citizen. Though so far removed from
the active centres of life, he kept touch with it by
the variety of his interests in all useful and benevolent
undertakings, to which an ample fortune
allowed him freely to contribute. "The hopes
entertained of his assistance and sympathy," observes
his biographer, "were never disappointed."
Among naval biographies, there is none that presents
a more pleasing picture of genial and dignified
enjoyment of well-earned repose. In 1831,
upon the accession of William IV., the Sailor
King, the long-coveted peerage was at last bestowed.
Lord de Saumarez died on the 9th of
October, 1836, in his eightieth year.</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="PELLEW" id="PELLEW"></a>PELLEW</h2>

<h4>1757-1833</h4>

<p>Like the English tongue itself, the names
of British seamen show the composite
origin of their nation. As the Danes after
the day of Copenhagen, to them both glorious
and disastrous, claimed that in Nelson they
had been vanquished by a man of their own
blood, descended from their Viking forefathers;
as Collingwood and Troubridge indicate the
English descent of the two closest associates of
the victor of Trafalgar; so Saumarez and the
hero of this sketch, whose family name was
Pellew, represent that conquering Norman race
which from the shores of the Northern ocean
carried terror along the coasts of Europe and
the Mediterranean, and as far inland as their
light keels could enter. After the great wars
of the French Revolution and the Battle of
Algiers, when Lord Exmouth had won his renown
and his position had been attained, kinship with
him was claimed by a family still residing in Normandy,
where the name was spelled "Pelleu."
Proof of common origin was offered, not only in
the name, but also in the coat of arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
In England, the Pellew family was settled in
the extreme southwest, in Cornwall and Devonshire,
counties whose nearness to the great
Atlantic made them the source of so much of
the maritime enterprise that marked the reign of
Elizabeth. Lord Exmouth's grandfather was a
man of wealth; but, as he left many children,
the juniors had to shift for themselves, and the
youngest son, Samuel Pellew, the father of the
admiral, at the time of the latter's birth commanded
a post-office packet on the Dover station.
He accordingly made the town of that
name the home of his wife and children; and
there Edward, the second of his four sons, was
born, April 19, 1757. Their mother was the
daughter of a Jacobite gentleman, who had been
out for the Pretender in 1715,&mdash;a fact which
probably emphasized the strong Hanoverian sympathies
of Samuel Pellew, whose habit was to
make his children, every Sunday, drink King
George's health upon their knees.</p>

<p>In 1765, when the future admiral was only
eight years old, his father died, and the mother
making an imprudent marriage three years later,
the children were thrown upon the world with
small provision and scanty care. The resolute,
active, and courageous character of the lads,
however, brought them well forward among
their equals in age. At school Edward was
especially distinguished for fearlessness. Of this
he gave a marked instance, when not yet twelve,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
by entering a burning house where gunpowder
was stored, which no other of the bystanders
would approach. Alone and with his own hands
the lad brought out the powder. A less commendable
but very natural result of the same
energetic spirit was shown in the numerous
fighting matches in which he was engaged.
Being threatened with a flogging for one of
these, the circumstance became the immediate
occasion of his going to sea. If flogged, he
declared, he would run away; and as a decided
taste for seafaring life had already manifested itself,
his guardian thought better to embrace at
once the more favorable alternative and enter
him regularly in the navy. He thus went afloat
towards the end of 1770, the date at which Nelson,
also, though one year younger, began his
career.</p>

<p>His first cruise was in the Mediterranean.
It came to a premature end through a quarrel
between the commander of the ship and one of
the midshipmen. In this the captain was clearly
and grossly in the wrong; yet nevertheless carried
his resentment, and the power of oppression in
his hands, then little restrained by law, so far as
to expel the youngster from the ship and set him
on shore in Marseilles. Pellew insisted upon
accompanying his messmate, and the two lads of
fourteen, aided by some of the lieutenants, secured
a passage home. It shows a pleasing trait in our
hero's character that, some years afterwards, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
advanced materially the professional fortunes of
the son of the officer who had thus abused his
authority.</p>

<p>He next passed under the command of a
Captain Pownoll, between whom and himself
were established such warm relations, of affectionate
interest on the one side and reverential
regard on the other, that Pownoll became a
family name among the descendants of the
admiral. He himself gave it to his first-born,
and it still appears in the present generation.
Under him, also, Pellew was brought into direct
contact with the American Revolution; for on
board the frigate <i>Blonde</i>, Pownoll's ship, General
Burgoyne embarked in 1775 for Canada, there
beginning the undertaking which ended so disastrously
for him. It is told that when the distinguished
passenger came on board, the yards
being manned to receive him with the honors due
to his rank, he was startled to see on one yardarm
a midshipman standing on his head. Upon
expressing alarm, he was laughingly reassured by
the captain, who said that Pellew&mdash;for he it was
who put this extra touch upon the general's reception&mdash;was
quite capable of dropping from the
yard, passing under the ship's bottom, and coming
up on the other side. A few days later the young
officer actually did leap from the yardarm, the
ship going fast through the water&mdash;not, however,
as bravado, but to aid a seaman who had fallen
overboard, and whom he succeeded in saving.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout his youth the exuberant vitality
of the man delighted in these feats of wanton
power. To overturn a boat by press of canvas,
as a frolic, is not unexampled among lads of daring;
but it is at least unusual, when a hat goes
overboard, to follow it into the water, if alone in
a boat under sail. This Pellew did, on one occasion,
when he was old enough to know better;
being at the moment in the open Channel, in a
small punt, going from Falmouth to Plymouth.
The freak nearly cost him his life; for, though
he had lashed the helm down and hove-to the
boat, she fell off and gathered way whenever he
approached. When at last he laid hold of her
rail, after an hour of this fooling, barely strength
remained to drag himself on board, where he fell
helpless, and waited long before his powers were
restored. It is trite to note in such exhibitions
of recklessness many of the qualities of the ideal
seaman, though not so certainly those of the foreordained
commander-in-chief. Pellew was a born
frigate captain.</p>

<p>At the end of 1775 the Americans were still
engaged in the enterprise against Quebec, the
disastrous termination of which is familiarly
known. After the fall of General Montgomery
in the unsuccessful night assault of December
31, 1775, the American operations were reduced
to a land blockade of the town, which was cut off
from the sea by ice in the river. A close investment
was thus maintained for five months, until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
the early part of May, 1776, when the place was
relieved by the arrival of a small naval force,
commanded by Captain Charles Douglas. Immediately
upon its appearance the commanding
British general Carleton, attacked the besiegers,
who, already prostrated by disease and privation,
abandoned their positions and fell back upon
Sorel, at the mouth of the river Richelieu, the
outlet from Lake Champlain to the St. Lawrence.
Here they remained until June, when the enemy,
who had received heavy reinforcements, advanced
in overpowering numbers. The Americans again
retired above the rapids of the Richelieu to St. Johns.
Thence there is a clear channel southward;
and embarking there, the retreating force
without further molestation reached Crown Point,
a fortified post a hundred miles distant, at the
head of the lake, commanding the narrow stream
to which it is reduced in its upper part. Twelve
miles above Crown Point is Ticonderoga, the
well-known border fortress of the Colonial and
Revolutionary wars; and for fifteen or twenty
miles farther the stream is navigable for boats of
some size, thus affording an easy means of communication
in those early days of impassable
forests and scanty transport.</p>

<p>Though greatly superior on land, the British
had now for a time to stay their pursuit; for the
water highway essential to its continuance was
controlled by the flotilla under the command of
Benedict Arnold, forbidding further advance until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
it was subdued. The presence of these vessels,
which, though few, were as yet unopposed, gained
for the Americans, in this hour of extremity, the
important respite from June to October, 1776;
and then the lateness of the season compelled
the postponement of the invasion to the following
year. The toil with which this little force
had been created, a few months before, was thus
amply justified; for delay is ever to the advantage
of the defence. In this case it also gave time
for a change of commanders on the part of the
enemy, from Carleton to Burgoyne, which not
improbably had a decisive effect upon the fortunes
of the next campaign.</p>

<p>As soon as established at St. Johns, the British
took steps to place a naval force upon the
lake, an undertaking involving trouble and delay,
notwithstanding their greatly superior resources
in men and material. Some thirty fighting vessels,
suitable to the waters upon which they were
to act, were required, and also four hundred bateaux
for the transport of the troops. These had
either to be built upon the spot, despite the lack
of all dockyard facilities, or else to be brought
bodily from the St. Lawrence, by road, or through
the rapids of the Richelieu, until the deep water
at St. Johns was reached. In this hardy, strenuous
work, Pellew naturally was conspicuously
active; and in its course he gained a particular
professional accomplishment which afterwards
stood him in good stead. Several vessels were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
built upon the shores of the stream; among others,
one of one hundred and eighty tons, the <i>Inflexible</i>,
whose heavier timbers were brought overland
to St. Johns. The construction of these craft
was superintended by a lieutenant&mdash;afterwards
Admiral Schank&mdash;of scientific knowledge as a
ship architect; and through close association
with him Pellew's instinctive appreciation of all
things nautical received an intelligent guidance,
which gave him a quick insight into the probable
behavior of a ship from an examination of her
build, and enabled him often to suggest a suitable
remedy for dangerous faults. During this period
of equipment occurred a characteristic incident
which has only recently become public through
a descendant.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> "On the day the <i>Inflexible</i> was
launched, Pellew on the top of the sheers was
trying to get in the mainmast. The machinery
not being of the best gave way, and down came
mainmast, Pellew, and all, into the lake. 'Poor
Pellew,' exclaimed Schank, 'he is gone at last!'
However, he speedily emerged and was the first
man to mount the sheers again. 'Sir,' Admiral
Schank used to conclude, 'he was like a squirrel.'"</p>

<p>Thirty days after the keel of the <i>Inflexible</i> was
laid at St. Johns, the vessel herself not only was
launched, but had set sail for the southward.
She carried eighteen twelve-pounders, nine on a
side, and was thus superior in power, not only to
any one vessel of the Americans, but to their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>whole assembled flotilla on Lake Champlain.
Except the principal pieces of her hull, the timber
of which she was built was hewed in the neighboring
forest; and indeed, the whole story of the
rapid equipment of this squadron recalls vividly
the vigorous preparation of Commander Perry, of
the United States navy, in 1813, for his successful
attempt to control Lake Erie. The entire
British force, land and naval, now moved toward
Crown Point. On the 11th of October the
American flotilla was discovered, a short distance
above Plattsburg and about twenty miles from
the foot of the lake, drawn up between Valcour
Island and the western shore, which are from one-half
to three-fourths of a mile apart. It lay there
so snugly that the British, wafted by a northwest
wind, had actually passed to the southward without
seeing it, and the discovery was purely accidental,&mdash;a
fact which suggests that Arnold, who
must have felt the impossibility of a force so
inferior as his own contesting, or even long
delaying, the enemy's advance by direct opposition,
may have entertained some purpose of
operating in their rear, and thus causing a diversion
which at this late season might effectually
arrest their progress. It is true that such a
stroke would frightfully imperil his little squadron;
but, in circumstances of absolute inferiority,
audacity, usually the best policy in war, offers the
only chance of success. Mere retreat, however
methodical, must end in final destruction. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
act towards St. Johns, trusting to dexterity and
to local knowledge of the network of islands at
the foot of the lake to escape disaster, or at least to
protract the issue, offered the best chance; and
that the situation thus accepted would not be
hopeless was proved by the subsequent temporary
evasion of pursuit by the Americans, even in the
open and narrow water of the middle lake.</p>

<p>The British moved to attack as soon as the
hostile shipping was discovered. Pellew was second
officer of the schooner <i>Carleton</i>, of twelve
guns, the third vessel of the flotilla in point of
force. The wind being contrary, and apparently
light, the <i>Carleton</i> alone of the sailing vessels got
into action; and although she was supported by
a number of rowing gunboats, whose artillery
was heavy, the match was unequal. According
to Arnold's own account, he had disposed his
gunboats and gondolas "on the west side of
Valcour Island, as near together as possible,
and in such a form that few vessels can attack
us at the same time, and those will be exposed
to the fire of the whole fleet." To this Captain
Douglas, in his report of the occurrences,
adds the suggestive particular that the <i>Carleton</i>,
by a lucky slant of wind, fetched "nearly into
the middle of the rebel half-moon, where she
anchored with a spring on her cable." The
position was one of honorable distinction, but
likewise of great exposure. Her first officer lost
an arm; her captain, Lieutenant Dacres, was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
severely wounded that he was about to be thrown
overboard as dead; and Pellew, thus left without
a superior, fought the vessel through the
engagement. When signal was at last made to
withdraw, the <i>Carleton</i> was able to do so only
by help of the gunboats, which towed her out
of fire. On the other hand, Arnold's flag-ship,
the schooner <i>Royal Savage</i>, which had fought
in advance of her consorts and under canvas,
fell to leeward, and came there under the distant
fire of the <i>Inflexible</i>, by which she was
badly crippled. She then was run ashore on the
southern point of the island, where she fell momentarily
into the hands of the British, who
turned her guns on her former friends. Later
in the day, it seeming probable that she might
be retaken, she was set on fire and burned to
the water's edge. Thus abandoned, she sank
to the bottom, where her hull rests to this day.
During the recent summer of 1901 some gun-carriages
have been recovered from her, after
lying for a century and a quarter beneath the
surface of the lake.</p>

<p>Pellew's personal activity and strength enabled
his gallantry to show to particular advantage
in this sanguinary contest. When the
<i>Carleton</i>, in her attempt to withdraw, hung in
stays under the island, her decks swept by the
bullets of the riflemen on shore, it was he who
sprang out on the bowsprit to bear the jib over
to windward. When the tow-rope was cut by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
a shot, it was Pellew again who exposed his
person for the safety of the vessel. His two
seniors being forced by their wounds to leave
the schooner, he succeeded to the command,
in which he was afterwards confirmed. In this
sharp affair the <i>Carleton</i> lost eight killed and
six wounded,&mdash;about half her crew,&mdash;and had
two feet of water in her hold when she anchored
out of range.</p>

<p>Towards evening the <i>Inflexible</i> succeeded in
getting within point-blank range of the American
flotilla, "when five broadsides," wrote Douglas,
"silenced their whole line;" a sufficient testimony
to the superiority of her concentrated
battery over the dispersed force of all her numerous
petty antagonists. The British then anchored
to the southward of Arnold's little force;
but that active and enterprising officer succeeded
in stealing during the night between the enemy
and the western shore, and retired towards Crown
Point. The chase to windward continued during
the next day, but a favorable shift of wind, to
the north, reached the British first, and enabled
them to close. Arnold again behaved with the extraordinary
bravery and admirable conduct which
distinguished him in battle. Sending on the bulk
of the squadron, he took the rear with two galleys,
covering the retreat. Fighting like a lion, he opposed
the enemy's advance long enough to secure
the escape of six of his vessels; and then, seeing
his one consort forced to strike, he ran his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
galley ashore and set her on fire. "Arnold," says
the naval historian Cooper, "covered himself with
glory, and his example seems to have been nobly
followed by most of his officers and men. The
manner in which the Congress was fought until
she had covered the retreat of the galleys, and the
stubborn resolution with which she was defended
until destroyed, converted the disasters of this
part of the day into a species of triumph." "The
Americans," says a contemporary British writer,
"chiefly gloried in the dangerous attention paid
by Arnold to a nice point of honor, in keeping
his flag flying, and not quitting his galley till
she was in flames, lest the enemy should have
boarded and struck it."</p>

<p>Pellew received like recognition, not, perhaps,
from the popular voice, but from his official superiors.
Douglas, the senior naval officer at
Quebec, who was made a baronet in reward of
these operations, Lord Howe at New York, and
the First Lord of the Admiralty in England, all
sent him personal letters of commendation; and
the two latter promised him promotion as soon
as he came within their respective jurisdictions.
His continuance at the front of operations during
this and the following year therefore postponed
his deserved advancement to a lieutenancy, by
retaining him from the "jurisdiction" of those
able to bestow it.</p>

<p>The two gallant enemies were soon again
brought together in an incident which came near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
to change the career of one of them, and, in so
doing, to modify seriously the fortunes of many
others. Arnold having one day pulled out on
the open lake, in his venturesome manner, Pellew
gave chase in another boat. The Americans
being hard pressed and capture probable, Arnold
unbuckled his stock and himself took an oar.
So nearly caught was he, that he had to escape
into the bushes, leaving behind him stock and
buckle; and these, as late as sixty years after,
remained in the possession of Pellew's brother.
Had he thus been deprived of the opportunity
that Saratoga gave him the next year, Arnold's
name might now be known to us only as that
of the brave officer who kept his country's flag
flying till his vessel was in flames.</p>

<p>On the 14th of October Carleton landed at
Crown Point, which the Americans had abandoned;
but the lateness of the season deterred
him from advancing against Ticonderoga, and
he soon afterwards returned to Canada. The
full import of this halt is too easily overlooked,
with consequent failure to appreciate the momentous
influence exerted upon the course of the
Revolutionary War by this naval campaign, in
which Pellew bore so conspicuous a part. It
has never been understood in America, where the
smallness of the immediate scale has withdrawn
attention from the greatness of the ultimate issue,
in gaining time for the preparations which resulted
in the admittedly decisive victories about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
Saratoga. "If we could have begun our expedition
four weeks earlier," wrote a German general
there present, "I am satisfied everything
would have been ended this year [1776]; were
our whole army here, it would be an easy matter
to drive the enemy from their entrenchments
at Ticonderoga." The delay, not of four weeks
only, but of the whole summer, was obtained
by the naval force organized upon Champlain
by Arnold and his superior, General Schuyler.
The following year the invasion was resumed,
under General Burgoyne. Pellew accompanied
him with a body of seamen, taking part in all
the operations down to the final surrender.
Burgoyne, indeed, afterwards chaffed him with
being the cause of the disaster, by rebuilding
the bridge which enabled the army to cross from
the east bank of the Hudson to the west.</p>

<p>Returning to England in the early part of 1778,
Pellew was made lieutenant, and in 1780 we find
him again serving under Captain Pownoll, as first
lieutenant of the <i>Apollo</i> frigate. On the 15th of
June, in the same year, the <i>Apollo</i> met the
French frigate <i>Stanislas</i>. A severe action followed,
and at the end of an hour Pownoll was
shot through the body. As his young friend
raised him from the deck, he had barely time to
say, "Pellew, I know you won't give his Majesty's
ship away," and immediately expired. The engagement
lasted an hour longer, when the enemy,
which had all the time been standing in for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
Belgian coast, took the ground, the most of her
spars, already wounded, going overboard with the
shock. The <i>Apollo</i> had hauled off a few moments
before, finding that she had less than five
feet of water under her keel.</p>

<p>Though unable again to attack the <i>Stanislas</i>,
which claimed the protection of the neutral flag,
the result was substantially a victory; but to
Pellew's grief for the death of a tried friend was
added the material loss of a powerful patron.
Happily, however, his reputation was known to
the head of the Admiralty, who not only promoted
him for this action, but also gave him a
ship, though a poor one. After a succession of
small commands, he was fortunate enough again
to distinguish himself,&mdash;driving ashore and destroying
several French privateers, under circumstances
of such danger and difficulty as to win
him his next grade, post-captain. This step,
which, so far as selection went, fixed his position
in the navy, he received on the 25th of May, 1782.</p>

<p>The ten years of peace that shortly followed
were passed by many officers in retirement, which
we have seen was contentedly accepted by his
distinguished contemporary, Saumarez; but Pellew
was a seaman to the marrow, and constantly
sought employment afloat. When out of occupation,
he for a while tried farming, the Utopian
employment that most often beguiles the imagination
of the inbred seaman in occasional weariness
of salt water; but, as his biographer justly re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>marks,
his mind, which allowed him to be happy
only when active, could ill accommodate itself
to pursuits that almost forbade exertion. "To
have an object in view, yet to be unable to advance
it by any exertions of his own, was to him
a source of constant irritation. He was wearied
with the imperceptible growth of his crops, and
complained that he made his eyes ache by watching
their daily progress."</p>

<p>His assiduous applications, however, were not
wholly unavailing to obtain him the professional
employments usually so hard to get in times of
peace. For five of the ten years, 1783-1793, he
commanded frigates, chiefly on the Newfoundland
station; and in them, though now turning thirty,
he displayed the superabundant vitality and restless
activity that had characterized his early youth.
"Whenever there was exertion required aloft,"
wrote a midshipman who served with him at this
period, "to preserve a sail or a mast, the captain
was foremost in the work, apparently as a mere
matter of amusement, and there was not a man
in the ship that could equal him in personal activity.
He appeared to play among the elements in
the hardest storms. I remember once, in close-reefing
the main topsail, the captain had given
his orders from the quarter-deck and sent us aloft.
On gaining the topsail yard, the most active and
daring of our party hesitated to go upon it, as the
sail was flapping violently, making it a service of
great danger; but a voice was heard from the ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>treme
end of the yard, calling upon us to exert
ourselves to save the sail, which would otherwise
beat to pieces. A man said, 'Why, that's the
captain! How the &mdash;&mdash; did he get there?' He
had followed us up, and, clambering over the
backs of the sailors, had reached the topmast
head, above the yard, and thence descended by
the lift,"&mdash;a feat unfortunately not easy to
be explained to landsmen, but which will be
allowed by seamen to demand great hardihood
and address.</p>

<p>All this was the simple overflow of an animal
energy not to be repressed, the exulting prowess of
a giant delighting to run his course. It found
expression also in joyous practical jests, like those
of a big boy, which at times had ludicrous consequences.
On one occasion of state ceremony,
the king's birthday, Pellew had dressed in full
uniform to attend a dinner on shore. The weather
was hot, and the crew had been permitted an
hour's swimming around the ship. While his
boat was being manned, the captain stood by the
frigate's rail watching the bathers, and near by
him was one of the ship's boys. "I too shall
have a good swim soon," called the latter to a
comrade in the water. "The sooner, the better,"
said Pellew, coming behind him and tipping him
overboard. No sooner had the lad risen to the
surface from his plunge than it was plain that he
could not swim; so in after him went the practical
joker, with all his toggery. "If ever the cap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>tain
was frightened," writes the officer just quoted,
"it was then."</p>

<p>But along with all this physical exuberance and
needless assumption of many of the duties of a
foremast hand, Pellew possessed to a very remarkable
extent that delicate art of seamanship which
consists in so handling a ship as to make her do
just what you want, and to put her just where she
should be; making her, to use a common sea
expression, do everything but talk. This is a
faculty probably inborn, like most others that
reach any great degree of perfection, and, while a
very desirable gift, it is by no means indispensable
to the highest order of naval excellence. Nelson
did not at all equal Pellew in this respect, as is
indicated by an amusing story transmitted by a
Colonel Stewart, who served on board the great
admiral's flag-ship during the expedition against
Copenhagen: "His lordship was rather too apt
to interfere in the working of the ship, and not
always with the best judgment or success. The
wind, when off Dungeness, was scanty, and the
ship was to be put about. Lord Nelson would
give the orders, and caused her to miss stays.
Upon this he said, rather peevishly, to the officer
of the watch, 'Well, now see what we have done.
Well, sir, what mean you to do now?' The
officer saying, with hesitation, 'I don't exactly
know, my lord. I fear she won't do,' Lord Nelson
turned sharply to the cabin, and replied, 'Well, I
am sure if you do not know what to do with her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
no more do I, either.' He went in, leaving the
officer to work the ship as he liked." Yet Nelson
understood perfectly what ships could do, and
what they could not; no one could better handle
or take care of a fleet, or estimate the possibility
of performing a given manoeuvre; and long before
he was called to high command he was distinguished
for a knowledge of naval tactics to
which few, if any other, of his time attained. He
was a great general officer; and whether he had
the knack of himself making a ship go through
all her paces without a fault mattered as little as
whether he was a crack shot with a gun.</p>

<p>A ship is certainly the most beautiful and
most graceful of machines; a machine, too, so
varied in its movements and so instinct with life
that the seaman affectionately transfers to her
credit his own virtues in handling her. Pellew's
capacity in this part of his profession was so
remarkable that it is somewhat singular to find
him, in his first frigate action, compelled to discard
manoeuvring, and to rely for victory upon
sheer pluck and luck. When war with the
French republic began in 1793, his high reputation
immediately insured him command of a
frigate, the <i>Nymphe</i>. The strength of England
as a naval power lay largely in the great reserve
of able seamen manning her merchant ships; but
as these were scattered in all quarters of the
world, great embarrassment was commonly felt at
the outbreak of a war, and especially when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
came with the unexpected rapidity of the revolutionary
fury. As the object of first importance
was to get the fleets of ships-of-the-line to sea,
Pellew had to depend chiefly upon his own indefatigable
exertions to procure a crew for his vessel.
Seamen being hard to find, he had on board
a disproportionate number of landsmen when the
<i>Nymphe</i>, on the 19th of June, 1793, encountered
the French vessel <i>Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre</i>, of force slightly inferior,
except in men, but not sufficiently so to
deny the victor the claim of an even fight.</p>

<p>A peculiar incident preceding the action has
interest, as showing the strong preoccupation of
men's minds at the opening of war, before meetings
with the enemy have lost novelty. Pellew's
younger brother, Israel, a commander in the
navy, being otherwise unemployed, had come out
with him for the cruise. The <i>Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre</i> having
been first seen in the early morning, Edward
would not have him called till just as the <i>Nymphe</i>
was closing. As he came on deck, the brother
said affectionately, "Israel, you have no business
here. We are too many eggs from one nest. I
am sorry I brought you from your wife." But
the other was unheeding, his eyes fixed upon the
stranger. "That's the very frigate," he cried,
"that I've been dreaming of all night! I
dreamt that we shot away her wheel." And,
hastening to the after-gun, he made the French
ship's wheel the object of an unremitting fire.</p>

<p>By the way the enemy was handled it was evi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>dent
that she was well manned and ably commanded.
She had, in fact, been in commission
for over a year. Great as was his own skill, Pellew
could not venture upon manoeuvres with a green
crew, untrained save at the guns, and only filled
the night before by pressing from a merchant
vessel. He therefore determined upon a simple
artillery duel. The Frenchman waited under
short canvas, while the <i>Nymphe</i>, with greater
way, drew slowly up on his starboard, or right-hand
side; both ships running nearly before the
wind, but having it a little on the left side. Each
captain stood uncovered, and as the bows of the
<i>Nymphe</i> doubled upon the stern of the <i>Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre</i>,
within three hundred feet, a French sailor was
seen to run aloft and fasten a red cap of liberty to
the mainmast head. The eyes of the British seamen
were fastened upon their commander, awaiting
the gesture which he had set, instead of word
of mouth, for opening fire. At quarter-past six
he gave it, raising his cap to his head. A furious
cannonade at once began, and, the <i>Nymphe</i> shortening
sail as soon as fairly abreast her antagonist,
the two frigates continued on parallel lines,
maintaining their relative positions as though at
anchor, and rolling easily in the soft summer
sea under the recoil of their guns. So nearly
matched were the gunners that the conflict, unusually
deadly though it was, might have lasted
long, but at a little before seven Israel Pellew's
dream was fulfilled. The Frenchman's wheel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
was shot away, and, the mizzenmast going overboard
at the same time, the <i>Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre</i> yielded to
the impulse of her forward sails, turned sharp
round to the right, and ran perpendicularly into
the <i>Nymphe</i>. The British boarded her, fixed in
this disadvantageous position, fought their way
aft, and, although the French crew was numerically
superior, in ten minutes hauled down the
colors. In this brief hour they had lost twenty-three
killed and twenty-seven wounded, the enemy
sixty-three killed and wounded, out of ships' companies
numbering respectively two hundred and
forty and three hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>This was the first decisive frigate action of the
War of the French Revolution, and in consequence
great was the enthusiasm aroused. Lord
Howe wrote to Pellew, "The manner in which
you have taken the enemy's ship will set an example
for the war." In truth, however, while
admitting the soundness of Pellew's judgment in
adopting the course he did, the actual demand
upon his personal skill was less, and in so far the
credit due therefore less, than in the second successful
frigate action, in the following October, in
which Sir James Saumarez commanded. Not
only was the French vessel's superiority in force
more marked in the latter instance, but Saumarez's
ship there met with an accident similar in character
to that which befell the <i>Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre</i>, from the
consequences of which she was extricated by his
masterly seamanship. Still, it may with fairness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
be argued that, as the one action from its attendant
circumstances evidenced the individual skill
of the commander, so the other testified to the
antecedent preparation and efficiency of the crew,
which are always to be attributed to the care of
the captain, especially under the conditions of
Pellew's enlistments. Both captains fully deserved
the reward of knighthood bestowed upon
their success. Israel Pellew was promoted to
post-captain.</p>

<p>During the first three years of this war British
commerce in the neighborhood of the Channel
suffered most severely from French cruisers.
The latter resumed the methods of Jean Bart
and other celebrated privateers of the days of
Louis XIV.; the essence of which was to prey
upon the enemy's commerce, not by single vessels,
but by small squadrons of from five to
seven. Cruisers so combined, acting in mutual
support, were far more efficient than the same
number acting separately. Spreading like a fan,
they commanded a wider expanse than a ship
alone; if danger arose, they concentrated for
mutual support; did opportunity offer, the work
was cut out and distributed, thus insuring by
co-operation more thorough results. At the suggestion
of Sir Edward Pellew, the British Admiralty
determined to oppose to these organized
depredators a similar system. Groups of crack
frigates were constituted, and sent to cruise
within the limits of the Channel Fleet, but inde<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>pendent
of its admiral. In these Pellew served
for the next five years, much of the time as squadron
commander; to him a period of incessant,
untiring activity, and illustrated by many brilliant
and exciting incidents, for which the limits of
this sketch afford no space.</p>

<p>There are, however, two episodes in which he
was so distinctly the central figure that they
demand at least a brief narration. In January,
1796, while his ship was repairing, a large East
Indiaman, the <i>Dutton</i>, carrying some six hundred
troops and passengers, was by a series of mishaps
driven ashore on the beach of Plymouth, then an
unprotected sound. As she struck, all her masts
went overboard, and she lay broadside to the
waves, pounding heavily as they broke over her.
Pellew was at this moment driving to a dinner
with his wife. Seeing crowds running from
various directions towards the same quarter, he
asked the reason. Upon learning it, he left his
carriage and hurried to the scene. When he
arrived, he recognized, by the confusion on board,
by the way the ship was laboring, by the poverty
of the means that had been contrived for landing
the imperilled souls,&mdash;only a single hawser having
been run to the shore,&mdash;that the loss of
nearly all on board was imminent. Night, too,
was falling, as well as the destruction of the vessel
impending. After vainly offering rewards to
the hardy boatmen standing by, if they would
board the wreck with a message from him, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
said, "Then I must go myself." Though then
close to forty years of age, his immense personal
strength and activity enabled him, though sorely
bruised thereby, to be hauled on board through
the breakers by the hawser, which alternately
slacked and then tightened with a jerk as the
doomed ship rolled to and fro in the seas. Once
on board, he assumed command, the want of
which, through the absence of the proper captain,
had until then hampered and well-nigh paralyzed
all effectual effort. When his well-known name
was spoken, three hearty cheers arose from the
troops on board, echoed by the thousands of spectators
on shore; and the hope that revived with
the presence of a born leader of men showed itself
at once in the renewed activity and intelligent
direction of effort, on the decks and on
the beach. The degree of the danger can be
estimated from the fact that boats from the ships
of war in port, his own included, tried in vain to
approach and had to run for safety to the inner
harbor. With sword drawn,&mdash;for many of the
soldiers were drunk and riotous,&mdash;Pellew maintained
order, guided with a seaman's readiness
the preparations for landing, and saw the women,
the children,&mdash;one child but three weeks old,&mdash;the
sick, landed first, then the soldiers, lastly
the seamen. When he himself was transferred
to the beach by the same means that his skill
had contrived for others, but three persons remained
on board, officers of the ship, who eased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
him on shore. The injuries he had received in
his perilous passage out, and which confined him
to his bed for a week, forbade his being last. To
the end of his life, this saving of the crew of the
<i>Dutton</i> was the action in which he took most
pride.</p>

<p>The year that opened with this magnificent
act of self-devotion saw Pellew, at its close, bearing
a seaman's part in the most serious crisis that
befell his country during the wars of the French
Revolution. The end of 1796 and the earlier
months of 1797 marked the nadir of Great
Britain's military fortunes. The successes of
Bonaparte's Italian campaign were then culminating;
Austria was on the point of making
peace with France; England was about to find
herself alone, and the discontent of the seamen
of the navy, long smouldering, was soon to break
out into the famous and threatening mutinies of
the Channel Fleet and of the Nore. At the same
time France, relieved on her eastern frontiers, felt
able to devote seventeen ships-of-the-line and
eighteen thousand troops to the invasion of
Ireland.</p>

<p>Pellew, with two frigates besides his own, was
stationed off the mouth of Brest harbor to watch
the enemy's movements; the main British fleet
being some fifty miles to seaward. To this
emergency he brought not only the intrepidity
of a great seaman and the ardor of an anxious
patriot, but likewise the intense though narrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
Protestant feeling transmitted from a past, then
not so remote, when Romanism and enmity to
England were almost synonymous. "How would
you like," said he to an officer who shared Pitt's
liberal tendencies, "to see Roman Catholic chaplains
on board our ships?" and to the end of his
life he opposed the political enfranchisement of
persons of that creed.</p>

<p>The French expedition against Ireland sailed
from Brest on the 16th of December, 1796. Having
sent off successively each of his consorts with
information for the fleet, Pellew remained with
his own ship alone, the <i>Indefatigable</i>, at the
moment of the final start. There are two principal
channels by which Brest can be left, one
leading to the south, the other due west. The
French admiral had at first intended to use the
former; but, the wind showing signs of an unfavorable
shift, he endeavored to change the
orders just as night was falling. The weather
being hazy, his signals were understood by but
few of the forty-odd vessels composing the force.
Eight or ten joined him; the remainder followed
the original instructions and went out by the
south. Pellew attached himself to the admiral's
division, kept along with it just out of gun-shot,
and by making false signals, burning blue lights
and sending up rockets, introduced into the attempts
to convey the wishes of the commander-in-chief
such confusion as rendered them utterly
futile. Having satisfied himself as to the general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
direction taken by the enemy, he left them, and
made all sail for Falmouth, where he arrived on
the 20th.</p>

<p>The general fortunes of the expedition do not
belong to the present story. Suffice it to say
that the greater part reached Ireland safely, but
through stress of weather was unable to land the
troops, and went back to France by detachments,
in January, 1797. It is during this process of
return that Sir Edward Pellew again appears, in
perhaps the most dramatic incident of his stirring
career.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of January 13th, being then in
company with the frigate <i>Amazon</i>, and about one
hundred and twenty miles west of Brest, a French
ship-of-the-line was discovered. The stranger,
named the <i>Droits de l'Homme</i>, was returning
from Ireland, and heading east. The frigates
steered courses converging towards hers, seeking
to cut her off from the land. The weather was
thick and gloomy, with a strong west wind fast
rising to a gale. At half-past four, as night was
falling, the French ship carried away her fore
and main topmasts in a heavy squall; and an
hour later the <i>Indefatigable</i>, now under close
reefs, passed across her stern, pouring in a broadside
from so near that the French flag floated
across her poop, where it was seized and torn
away by some of the British seamen. The
enemy, having on board nearly a thousand
soldiers besides her crew, replied with rapid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
volleys of musketry, and, as the frigate passed
ahead, sheered impetuously towards her, attempting
to board, and in her turn grazing the
stern of the <i>Indefatigable</i>. In another hour the
<i>Amazon</i> drew up, and then the British vessels
took their positions, one on either bow of the
<i>Droits de l'Homme</i>, whence, by movements of
the helm, they alternately raked her. The labor
of the gunners, however, was arduous, due to the
deep rolling of the ships, on board which, also,
the seas poured in volumes through the gun-ports.
On the main decks the men fought up to
their middles in water, the heavy cannon broke
away from the breechings, or ropes used to control
them, and even iron bolts tore out from the
ships' sides under the severe recoil of the guns.
Thus through the long winter night the three
ships rushed headlong before the gale towards
the French coast, intent on mutual destruction;
the constant storm of shot, though flying wild
under the violent motions of the vessels, tearing
through spars and rigging, and crippling them in
much that was essential to their safety.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the morning of the 14th,
long before daybreak, land was sighted right
ahead. The <i>Indefatigable</i> hauled at once to
the southward, the <i>Amazon</i> to the northward;
the enemy alone, seemingly unconscious of the
danger, kept on, and as she passed Pellew's ship
fired a broadside which severely wounded all
the masts. The situation of the combatants was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
well-nigh desperate. They had reached the coast
of France at a point where it forms a deep recess,
called Audierne Bay, from either side of which
project capes that must be cleared in order to
gain once more the open sea. One only of the
three escaped. The <i>Droits de l'Homme</i>, unmanageable
for want of sail power, tried to
anchor, but drove, and struck on a shoal some
distance from the beach. Of sixteen hundred
souls on board when the battle began, over one
hundred had been killed; and of those who survived
the fight three hundred perished in the
wreck. The <i>Amazon</i>, likewise crippled, though
not so badly, had gone ashore to the northward
only ten minutes after she ceased firing. Of her
people, but six were drowned. The <i>Indefatigable</i>,
beating back and forth against the gale before the
scene of the French disaster, upon which her crew
gazed with the solemn feeling that such might
soon be their own fate, succeeded at last in clearing
the southern cape. At eleven o'clock, nearly
twenty-four hours after first meeting the foe, and
with six feet of water in her hold, she passed
only three-quarters of a mile outside of the Penmarcks,
a rocky promontory thirty miles south
of Brest.</p>

<p>This remarkable encounter is said to have suggested
to Marryat the vivid sea picture with
which "The King's Own" ends. Pellew's unusual
personal endurance was signally illustrated
on the same day, very shortly after the safety of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
the ship from wreck was assured. Her principal
sails had been so torn by shot as to require
immediate renewing, and this had scarcely been
done when two vessels were sighted, one of which
was for the moment supposed to be the <i>Amazon</i>,
whose fate was yet unknown. Pellew gave orders
to chase, but his officers represented to him that,
whatever he himself was capable of, the ship's
company was too exhausted for present further
exertion; and that, besides, the ammunition was
very short, almost the last filled cartridge having
been expended. Under these circumstances he
was compelled to desist.</p>

<p>The interest of Pellew's career centres mainly
in his command of frigates. This independent
but yet restricted sphere afforded the fullest
scope for a conspicuous display of those splendid
qualities&mdash;fearlessness, enterprise, sound judgment,
instant decision, and superb seamanship&mdash;which
he so eminently possessed. He was,
above all, the frigate captain. "Nothing like
hesitation was ever seen in him. His first order
was always his last; and he often declared of
himself that he never had a second thought
worth sixpence." In 1799, by a new Admiralty
rule, he was transferred to the <i>Imp&eacute;tueux</i>, a ship-of-the-line,
and thenceforth served in that class
of vessel until his promotion to admiral.</p>

<p>As a general officer, Pellew had no opportunity
to show whether he possessed ability of the
highest order. For five years he held the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>mand
in India; and soon after Collingwood's
death he was, in 1811, appointed commander-in-chief
in the Mediterranean. On both stations
he evinced that faculty for careful organization,
systematic preparation, and sagacious distribution
of force which carries success up to the point
which administrative capacity can reach. His
ability in planning, while yet a subordinate in
command of squadrons, had been recognized by
St. Vincent during his management of the Brest
blockade. "The disposition made by Sir Edward
Pellew for the descent on a certain point is the
most masterly I have ever seen.... Although
the naval command in Quiberon may appear too
important for a captain, I shall not divest him of
it, unless I am ordered to do so; feeling a
thorough conviction that no man in His Majesty's
Navy, be his rank ever so high, will fill it
so well." At the time this was written, June,
1800, he had seven ships-of-the-line under his
orders. After the Peace of Amiens, when war
again began in 1803, he commanded a similar
division watching the Spanish port of Ferrol, in
which, although formally neutral, a French division
lay at anchor; and in discharge of this duty,
both as a seaman and an administrator, he again
justified the eulogium of the old Earl, now at the
head of the navy as First Lord.</p>

<p>In 1804 he was promoted Rear-Admiral, and
soon afterwards assigned to the East India
Station, which he held from 1805 to 1809. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
no naval actions on the great scale were to be
fought, but under his systematic organization
of convoys and cruisers for the protection of
commerce the insurance premium&mdash;the war risk&mdash;on
the most exposed routes fell markedly,&mdash;for
the port of Bombay fifty per cent less than at
any former period of hostilities; while the losses
by capture, when the merchants observed his
instructions, amounted to but one per cent on
the property insured, which was less than those
caused by the dangers of the sea, and considerably
less, also, than the average war losses in
other parts of the world. All this shows great
ability, carefully utilized in diligent preparation
and efficient precaution; and the same characteristics
are to be observed in his administration of
the Mediterranean command, of wider scope and
more purely military importance. Nevertheless,
it gives no sure proof of the particular genius
of a great captain. Whether, having forged his
weapon, Pellew could also wield it; whether,
having carefully sowed, he could also reap the
harvest by large combinations on the battle-field,
must remain uncertain, at least until probable
demonstration of his conceptions is drawn from
his papers. Nothing is as yet adduced to warrant
positive inference.</p>

<p>Pellew's Mediterranean command coincided in
time with the period of Napoleon's falling fortunes.
After Trafalgar, the Emperor decided to
increase his navy largely, but to keep it in port<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
instead of at sea, forcing Great Britain also to
maintain huge fleets, the expense of which, concurring
with the commercial embarrassments that
he sought to bring upon her, might exhaust her
power to continue the war. In consequence of
this policy, British military achievement on the
grand scale was confined to the army in the
Spanish peninsula; and in the bestowal of rewards,
after Napoleon's first abdication, but one
peerage was given to the navy. The great claims
of Sir James Saumarez, who was the senior of
the two, were disregarded on the ground that his
flag was not flying at the moment, and Pellew
was created Baron Exmouth.</p>

<p>During the process of settlement which succeeded
the final fall of Napoleon at Waterloo, Lord
Exmouth remained in the Mediterranean. In the
early part of 1816 he was ordered to visit with his
fleet the Barbary ports, and to compel the unconditional
release of all slaves who were natives of
the Ionian Islands; they having become subjects
of Great Britain by the terms of the peace. For
many years, while the powers of Europe were
engrossed in the tremendous strife of the French
Revolution, these piratical states, under pretence
of regular hostilities, had preyed upon the coasts
as well as upon the commerce of the weak
Mediterranean countries, and captives taken by
them were kept in bitter slavery. Nelson in his
correspondence, in 1796, mentions a curious incident
which sufficiently characterizes the general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
motives and policy of these barbarian Courts.
He asked an Algerine official visiting his ship,
why the Dey would not make peace with
Genoa and Naples, for they would pay well
for immunity, as the United States also at that
time did. The reply was, "If we make peace
with every one, what is the Dey to do with his
ships?" In his later experience with the Mediterranean
the great admiral realized yet more
forcibly the crying shame of Great Britain's
acquiescence. "My blood boils that I cannot
chastise these pirates. They could not show
themselves in this sea did not our country permit.
Never let us talk of the cruelty of the
African slave trade, while we permit such a
horrid war." The United States alone, although
then among the least of naval powers, had taken
arms before 1805 to repress outrages that were
the common reproach of all civilized nations,&mdash;a
measure the success of which went far to establish
the character of her navy and prepare it for 1812.
Lord Exmouth was also directed to demand peace
for Sardinia, as well as for any other state that
should authorize him to act for it. Only Naples
availed itself of this opportunity.</p>

<p>As far as his instructions went, his mission
was successful, and, by a happy accident, he was
able at Tunis and Tripoli to extort further from
the rulers a promise that thereafter captives
should be treated as in civilized countries; in
other words, that they should no longer be re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>duced
to slavery. Algiers refused this concession;
and the admiral could not take steps to
enforce it, because beyond his commission. The
Dey, however, undertook to consult the Porte;
and the fleet, with a few exceptions, returned to
England, where it arrived towards the end of
June.</p>

<p>Meanwhile British public feeling had become
aroused; for men were saying that the outrages
of the past had been rather welcome to the commercial
selfishness of the country. The well-protected
traders of Great Britain, shielded by
her omnipotent navy, had profited by crimes
which drove their weaker rivals from the sea.
Just then news came that at the port of Bona,
on the Algiers coast, where there was under the
British flag an establishment for carrying on
the coral fishery, a large number of the fishermen,
mostly Italians, had been wantonly slaughtered
by a band of Turkish troops. To insist,
arms in hand, upon reparation for such an outrage,
and upon guarantees for the future, would
doubtless be condemned by some of our recent
lights; but such was not then the temper of
Great Britain. The government determined at
once to send a fleet to the spot, and Lord Exmouth
was chosen for the command, with such a
force as he himself should designate. The gist
of his instructions was to demand the release,
without ransom, of <i>all</i> Christian slaves, and a
solemn declaration from the Dey that, in future<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
wars, prisoners should receive the usage accorded
them by European states. Great Britain thus
made herself, as befitted the obligation imposed
by her supreme maritime power, the avenger of
all those oppressed by these scourges of the sea.
The times of the barbarians were fulfilled.</p>

<p>During a long career of successful piracy, the
port of Algiers had accumulated an extensive
and powerful system of defences. These had
doubtless suffered in condition from the nonchalant
fatalism of Turkish rule, encouraged by a long
period of impunity; but they constituted still,
and under all the shortcomings of the defenders,
a most imposing menace to an attacking fleet.
To convey a precise impression of them by
detailed verbal description would be difficult, and
the attempt probably confusing. It may be said,
in brief, that the town faces easterly, rising
abruptly up a steep hill; that from its front there
then projected a pier, nearly a thousand feet long,
at whose end was a circular fort, carrying seventy
guns in three tiers; from that point a mole extended
at right angles to the southward,&mdash;parallel,
that is, in a general sense, to the town
front, but curving inward through the southern
half of its length, so as better to embrace and
shelter the vessels inside. This mole was somewhat
over a thousand feet in length, and had
throughout two tiers of guns, linked at their
northern extremity to the circular fort at the pier
end. These principal works were flanked and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
covered, at either end and on the hillside, by
others which it is unnecessary to particularize.
The total number of guns bearing seaward numbered
near three hundred, of very respectable size
for that day. The basin formed by the pier and
the mole constituted the port proper, and in
it, at the time of the attack, was collected the
entire Algerine navy, nine frigates and corvettes
and thirty-seven gunboats, the paltry force that
had so long terrorized the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In prevision of his present enterprise, Lord
Exmouth before leaving the Mediterranean had
despatched a light cruiser to Algiers, on a casual
visit similar to those continually made by ships
of war to foreign ports. Her commander, Captain
Charles Warde, received from him very
precise and most secret instructions to examine
closely into the defences and soundings; to do
which it was necessary not only to observe every
precaution of seeming indifference,&mdash;even to
the extent of appearing engrossed with social
duties,&mdash;but also to conduct under this cover
measurements and observations of at least approximate
correctness. This duty was performed
with singular diligence and success, with the
double result of revealing the hopeless inaccuracy
of existing charts and of placing in Exmouth's
hands a working plan of the ground, perfectly
trustworthy for his tactical dispositions.</p>

<p>As before remarked, in the sketch of Lord
St. Vincent, the defence and attack of seaports,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
involving as they do both occupation of permanent
positions and the action of mobile bodies,
are tactical questions. They differ much, though
not radically, from operations in the open sea,
or in the field, where positions may be taken
incidentally, but where the movements of mobile
bodies are the principal factor. In this
way, though without using the word tactical,
Exmouth treated the problem before him. Furnished,
thanks to his own foresight and Warde's
efficiency, with reliable information concerning
the preparations of the enemy, he calculated the
dispositions necessary to meet them and to crush
their fire. Having assigned to the hostile works,
severally and collectively, the force needed to
overbear them, and having arranged the anchoring
positions for the vessels of his command
with reference to the especial task of each, as
well as for mutual support, he had substantially
his plan of battle, afterwards communicated to
the fleet before going into action; and the same
data afforded the foundation for his statement to
the Government of the number and character
of ships needed for success.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the Admiralty, Lord Exmouth
asked for but five ships-of-the-line, five
frigates, and five smaller vessels, to which were
added four mortar boats to play upon the town
and arsenal. When met with expressions of
doubt, he replied, "I am satisfied, and take the
responsibility entirely upon myself." To satisfy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
the hesitancy of the Government, he left with
the Secretary to the Admiralty a written statement
that his every requirement had been fulfilled,
and that to him alone, therefore, would
failure from deficient power be attributable. On
the eve of departure he said to his brother Israel,
"If they open fire when the ships are coming
up, and cripple them in their masts, the difficulty
and loss will be greater; but if they allow
us to take our stations, I am sure of them, for
I know that nothing can resist a line-of-battle
ship's fire." He trusted to the extreme care of
his preparations, which neglected no particular
of equipment or organization, elaborating every
detail of training and discipline, and providing,
by the most diligent foresight and minute instruction,
that each officer concerned should know
exactly what was expected of him. In short,
it was to perfection of quality, and not to an
unwieldy bulk of superfluous quantity, that Exmouth
confided his fortunes in this last hazard.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed from England on the 28th
of July, 1816, was joined at Gibraltar by a Dutch
squadron of five frigates, whose commander asked
to share the coming contest, and on the 26th of
August was off the north point of Algiers Bay,
some twenty miles from the town. At daybreak
the next morning, the weather being almost calm,
a flag of truce was sent in, bearing the British
demands. During its absence a breeze from the
sea sprang up, and the fleet stood in to a mile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
from the works, where it stopped to await the
reply. At two P.M. the boat was seen returning,
with the signal that no answer had been given.
The flag-ship queried, "Are you ready?" Each
ship at once replied, "Yes;" and all filling away
together stood down to the attack, the admiral
leading.</p>

<p>The Algerine batteries were fully manned;
the mole, moreover, was crowded with troops.
With singular temerity, they fired no gun as the
ships came on, thus relieving the most anxious
of Exmouth's preoccupations concerning the difficulties
before him; fearing, seemingly, that, if
otherwise received, the prey might turn and escape.
The British, on their side, observed the
utmost silence; not a gun, not a cheer, marred
the solemn impression of the approach. The
flag-ship, <i>Queen Charlotte</i>,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> piloted by an officer
who had served continuously with Exmouth since
1793, anchored by the stern across the mole head,
at a distance of fifty yards, her starboard batteries
pointing to sweep it from end to end. Still
no sound of battle, as she proceeded to lash her
bows to those of an Algerine brig lying just
within the mole. This done, her crew gave three
cheers, as well they might. Then the stolid,
unaccountable apathy of the barbarians ceased,
and three guns in quick succession were fired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>from the eastern battery. Stirred by a movement
of compassion, Lord Exmouth, from the flag-ship's
poop, seeing the Moorish soldiery clustered
thick upon the parapets to watch the ships,
waved to them with his hand to get down. At
the first hostile gun he gave the order "Stand
by!" at the second, "Fire!" and simultaneously
with the third the <i>Queen Charlotte's</i> broadside
rang out, and the battle began.</p>

<p>The other vessels of the squadron were not all
as successful as the flag-ship in taking the exact
position assigned, and the admiral's plan thereby
suffered some of that derangement to which every
undertaking, especially military and naval, is liable.
This, however, produced no effect upon
the general result, except by increasing somewhat
the lists of killed and wounded, through loss of
advantageous offensive position, with consequent
defect in mutual support. But the first broadside
is proverbially half the battle. It was a saying
of Collingwood to his crew, in a three-decker like
the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, that if they could deliver
three effective fires in the first five minutes no
vessel could resist them; and this was yet more
certain when opposed to the semi-discipline of
adversaries such as the Algerine pirates. Exmouth's
general design was to concentrate his
heavy ships at the southern end of the mole,
whence the curve in the line of batteries would
enable them to enfilade or take in reverse the
works at the northern extremity. Here were to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
be the two three-deckers, with a seventy-four between
them, all three in close order, stem to stern.
The two-decker, however, anchored some seven
hundred feet astern of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, the
intervening space being left empty until filled
by a thirty-six-gun frigate, upon whose captain
St. Vincent passed the eulogium, "He seems to
have felt Lord Nelson's eye upon him." The
two remaining seventy-fours placed themselves
successively close astern of the first, which was in
accord with the original purpose, while the other
three-decker took the right flank of the line, and
somewhat too far out; in which exposed and unintended
position, beyond the extreme north
point contemplated for the British order, she
underwent a very heavy loss.</p>

<p>In general summary, therefore, it may be said
that the broadsides of the ships-of-the-line were
opposed from end to end to the heavy central
batteries on the mole, while the lighter vessels engaged
the flanking works on the shore to the southward,
thus diverting the fire which would have
harassed the chief assailants,&mdash;a service in which
the Dutch squadron, composed entirely of frigates,
rendered important assistance. The bomb
vessels from the rear threw their shells over the
fighting ships into the town and arsenal, and in
the admiral's report are credited with firing all the
shipping in the harbor, except one frigate, creating
a conflagration which spread over the arsenal
and storehouses. Soon after the contest opened,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
the thirty-seven Algerine gunboats, crowded with
troops, were seen advancing under cover of the
smoke to board the flag-ship. The attempt, rash
to insanity, met the fate it should have expected;
thirty-three were sent to the bottom by the guns of
the <i>Leander</i>, stationed ahead of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>,
and commanding the entrance to the port.
An hour later, Lord Exmouth determined to set
fire to the remaining frigate. The service was
performed by an officer and boat's crew, with a
steadiness which elicited from him such admiration
that, on the return of the party, he stopped
the working of the ship's upper battery to give
them three cheers. As the hostile vessel burned,
she drifted so near the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> as nearly
to involve her in the same fate.</p>

<p>From three to ten P.M. the battle lasted, steady
disciplined valor contending with a courage in no
way inferior, absolutely insensible to danger, but
devoid of that coherent, skilful direction which is
to courage what the brain and eye are to the
heart. "I never," wrote Exmouth to his brother,
"saw any set of men more obstinate at their guns,
and it was superior fire only that could keep them
back. To be sure, nothing could stand before
the <i>Queen Charlotte's</i> broadside. Everything
fell before it, and the Swedish consul assures me
we killed above five hundred at the very first fire,
from the crowded way in which the troops were
drawn up, four deep above the gunboats, which
were also full of men. It was a glorious sight,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
he continues, "to see the <i>Charlotte</i> take her anchorage,
and to see her flag towering on high,
when she appeared to be in the flames of the
mole itself; and never was a ship nearer burnt; it
almost scorched me off the poop. We were
obliged to haul in the ensign, or it would have
caught fire." He was himself struck thrice,
though not seriously injured. A cannon-ball
carried away the skirts of his coat, and one glass
of the spectacles in his pocket was broken, and
the frame bulged, by a shot.</p>

<p>At ten P.M., the ammunition of the fleet running
short, and its work being substantially accomplished,
the ships began to haul off. The sea
defences and a great part of the town were in
ruins. "To be again effective," wrote Exmouth,
"the defences must be rebuilt from the foundation."
The flanking batteries and the hill forts
continued to annoy the vessels as they retired,
but the spirit of the Dey was broken. Towards
eleven a light air from the land sprang up, which
freshened into a violent and prolonged thunderstorm,
lasting for three hours; and the flashes of
heaven's artillery combined with the glare of the
burning town to illuminate the withdrawal of the
ships.</p>

<p>The following morning the Dey signified his
submission, and on the 30th of August Lord
Exmouth made known to the fleet that all the
terms of Great Britain had been yielded; that
Christian slavery was forever abolished, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
by noon of the following day all slaves then in
Algiers would be delivered to his flag. This was
accordingly done, the whole number amounting
to 1642; which, with those previously released
at Tunis and Tripoli, raised to 3003 the human
beings whom Exmouth had been the instrument
of freeing from a fate worse than death.
Of this total, but eighteen were English; the
remainder were almost wholly from the Mediterranean
countries. On the 3d of September, just
one week after the attack, the fleet sailed for
England.</p>

<p>Profuse acknowledgment necessarily awaited
the hero of a deed in which national exultation
so happily blended with the sentiment of
pity for the oppressed. The admiral was raised
to the next rank in the peerage, and honors
poured in upon him from every side,&mdash;from
abroad as well as from his own countrymen. His
personal sense of the privilege permitted him,
thus to crown a life of strenuous exertion by a
martial deed of far-reaching beneficence, was a
reward passing all others. In the opening words
of his official report he voices his thankfulness:
"In all the vicissitudes of a long life of public
service, no circumstance has ever produced on
my mind such impressions of gratitude and joy
as the event of yesterday. To have been one of
the humble instruments in the hands of Divine
Providence for bringing to reason a ferocious
Government, and destroying for ever the horrid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
system of Christian slavery, can never cease to
be a source of delight and heartfelt comfort to
every individual happy enough to be employed
in it."</p>

<p>Here Lord Exmouth's career closes. Just
forty years had elapsed since as a youth he had
fought the <i>Carleton</i> on Lake Champlain, and he
was yet to live sixteen in honored retreat; bearing,
however, the burden of those whose occupation
is withdrawn at an age too advanced to form
new interests. Though in vigorous health and
with ample fortune, "he would sometimes confess,"
says his biographer, "that he was happier
amid his early difficulties." The idea of retirement,
indeed, does not readily associate itself
with the impression of prodigious vitality, which
from first to last is produced by the record of
his varied activities. In this respect, as in others,
the contrast is marked between him and Saumarez,
the two who more particularly illustrate
the complementary sides of the brilliant group of
naval leaders, in the second rank of distinction,
which clustered around the great names of Nelson,
Howe, and Jervis. In the old age of Saumarez,
the even, ordered tenor of his active military life
is reflected in the peaceful, satisfied enjoyment of
repose and home happiness, of the fruits of labors
past, which Collingwood, probably without good
reason, fancied to be characteristic of his own
temperament. Lord Exmouth, compelled to be
a passive spectator, saw with consequent increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
apprehension the internal political troubles of
Great Britain in his later days. Though not a
party man, he was strongly conservative, so that
the agitations of the Reform era concealed from
him the advantages towards which it was tending,
and filled him with forebodings for the future of
his country.</p>

<p>Like his distinguished contemporary, Admiral
Saumarez, and like many others of those lion-hearted,
masculine men who had passed their lives
amid the storms of the elements and of battle,&mdash;and
like our own Farragut,&mdash;Lord Exmouth
was a deeply religious man. Strong as was his
self-reliance in war and tempest, he rested upon
the Almighty with the dependence of a child
upon its father. His noble brother, Sir Israel
Pellew, who had followed Nelson into the fire at
Trafalgar, departed with the words, "I know in
Whom I have believed;" and of the admiral
himself, an officer who was often with him during
the closing scene said, "I have seen him great in
battle, but never so great as on his deathbed."</p>

<p>Lord Exmouth died on January 23, 1833. He
was at the time Vice-Admiral of England, that
distinguished honorary rank having been conferred
upon him but a few months before his
death.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of the last four admirals whose careers have
been here sketched, Howe alone inherited for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>tune
and high social rank; but he also fought his
way far beyond the modest position bequeathed
to him by his brother. Eminent all, though in
varying manner and degree, each illustrated a
distinct type in the same noble profession. All
were admirable officers, but they differed greatly
in original endowments and consequent development.
It was intuitive with St. Vincent to take
wide and far-sighted views, and to embody them
in sustained, relentless action. Endued by nature
with invincible energy and determination, he
moved spontaneously and easily along his difficult
path. He approached, although he did not attain
genius. In Howe is seen rather the result of
conscientious painstaking acting upon excellent
abilities, but struggling always against a native
heaviness and a temper constitutionally both
indolent and indulgent; a temper to which
indeed he does not yield, over which he triumphs,
but which nevertheless imposes itself upon his
general course with all the force inseparable from
hereditary disposition. A man of talent, he
educates himself to acquirements which in his
rival have the character of perception; and only
under the spur of emergency does he rise to the
height of greatness. Both were great general
officers, a claim which can scarcely be advanced
for Saumarez and Exmouth, able, brilliant, and
devoted as they were. Saumarez was the steadfast,
skilful, accomplished master of his profession,
but one whose aptitudes and tastes placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
him in the great organization of the fleet, as a
principal subordinate rather than as head. Exmouth
was the typical, innate seaman, intensely
active, whose instincts are those of the partisan
warrior, and who shines most in the freedom of
detached service. All bore a conspicuous part
in the greatest war of modern times, with honor
such that their names will be remembered as
long as naval history endures.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
